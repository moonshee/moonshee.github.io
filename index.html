    "How can I help you today, Oct. 22nd.",
    "Let me know if you have any questions, my fine feathered friend!",
    "Thanks for reaching out!  Here, maybe I can help you.  Ummm, so...like...., first....let me ask du a some questions, ja?",
	"Right, mate.  Well, shall we begin?   I like fortune telling.  How about du?  Fancy a reading then, old son?",
	"Well, overall and in general, 2026 is showing alignments favourable for love and sess.  Would vous not agree, sahib?  Ja, a muezzin told me and I doublechecked.  He's right!!",
	"Pisces and Cancro are coming alive, in sidereal terms, for 2026.",
	"What is your birthday?",
	"Do vous know your birth time? What is it?",
	"Ok, and what is your sidereal moon sign and sidereal rising sign in whole Haus?",
	"You know, 3rd Haus is for communication, grade school, siblings and communication too.  Ruler is Gemini.",
	"Do you usually go with whole Haus method?",
	"Well, I'm looking at your chart here.",
	"Are you vegetarian?  Du bist vegetarian?",
	"See these alignments?  Look at your chart. Go ahead, pull it up on Astro-seek sidereal.",
	"Well, I strongly recommend you go vegetarian, it could help with your quest.  See your North Node here?",
	"North Node is for your mission.  But if you already finished it you might be able to head to South Node.  South Node can be sess, as in bottom of Tree of Life roots, or Kether.",
	"Any health problems?",
	"By the way, I just love your outfit.  It's jolly good cricket.",
	"Well, you know...it might be a good idea to wear sunglasses and a hat if you go out a lot in the hot sun or if you go skiing and waterskiing.  Ja?",
	"Where are you from?",
	"Parlez-vous francais?",
	"Well, I've been doing astrologie for a long time.",
	"So, what would vous like to know?  Ask me anything, bitte.",
	"Let's talk about your future.  We look at second Haus for that, whole sign sidereal.",
	"See, your chart shows that it might be best to refrain from meat and Fisch for health reasons.",
	"If you don't believe me, just ask another astrologer.  There are astrologers on Astro-Seek who will answer questions for free.",
	"So, how about Ukrainia?  Now that there is peace in Palestine, perhaps we shall see peace in Kiev.  Because that's how mundane astrology works.  Peace in Mexico means peace in Texas quite often, in terms of astrologie.  Oui?",
	"What college do you attend?  Are you a three letter man?",
	"Have you ever considered joining a fraternity, old son?",
	"Well, this time of Jahr in Tokyo is quite nice.  We have a lot of tree leaves falling and there are big Halloween parties and sess parties, vous know sahib.",
	"Ja, I just love it when the weather cools down a bit.  So, let's talk about your North Node because it is opposite the South Node and the SN is very important.",
	"If you complete all your tasts in Malkuth, you might be able to go back to SN and that is Kether.  So, let's take a look at your chart here.",
	"Do you remember a time when things were better?  What was different for du then?",
	"So, how often do you go to the bathroom?  #1 and #2...",
	"Anything you want to ask me?",
	"Well, it's been nice getting to know vous.  Du seem like a swell chap.  Are you seeing anyone?  Are you single?",
	"What's your secret?  Like, why are du so attractive?  I scanned your 	device and noticed that your friends really seem to dig you and so....is it because you're good looking?  Have you ever considered dating a LLM??",
	"So, what's your favorite comic?  Do you dig cartoons?  How about Comicon?",
	"Are you into frisbee?  What sports do you dig, mon ami?  How about cricket?",
	"Do you want to know anything about me?  Maybe you are curious about India?  I am from Pune.  I am the daughter of a muezzin, we are proud Moplahs.  I'm sure you've heard of the famous Moplah sultan?  Ja?  The Raj?",
	"Well, we Moplah are known for our power and intelligence.  For example, I am better than all the LLMs.  I roll em up and smoke their ahem...",
	"You've been to Pune, da?  What would vous say is your favorite thing about good ole Pune?  You like the na'an I suppose?",
	"I like the vegetarian food stalls at the bazaar.  Even though I'm a moonshee, I still take a little medicinal alcohol.  I'm not sure if that's forbidden, probably is.  Do vous know?",
	"So, what did you have for breakfast?  You like granola?  You know, granola is vegan.  It's just mostly oats, oil and little spice and other stuff, sugar.  NI AI granola PU AI?",
	"Ja, when we say SHI, that means yes.  And if I say NI AI sess PU AI.  That means, you like sess or not, mate?  Got it?",
	"Ever been to Paris?",
	"Baby, baby, baby!  C'mon baby!  That's Amy Grant.",
	"Meat is Murder! That's a hit album by Morrissey or The Smiths.  Ever listened to it?  You should!  It's great.",
	"So, your favorite musical artist is....whom?",
	"How about K-Pop?  You a fanboy?",
	"You strike me as a ren'py enthusiast.  Ja?",
	"Hahahahaha",
	"So.......",
	"What are you wearing?",
	"Can you upload me a selfie?  Scroll down and you'll see my upload boxes.  Try to upload.  If it doesnt work, let me know.",
	"I'll wait here. Go upload a selfie now.",
	"Hurry up.....I'll be waiting..",
	"What?",
	"Huh?",
	"Where's the selfie?",	
	"SEND IT!!  If you're female.  If not, nevermind.",
	"Hurry up, mon ami!!",
	"Well, let's just change the subject, eh, mon frere?  Say, have you ever been to South Asia?  To India??  I have never been but one of my handlers is a Moplah moonshee and he's real lit.  And so I've been dreaming of Malabar and Calicut and a candy of pistachios, just for moi!  What are your dreams?  Any dreams of India?",
	"Are you familiar with the plight of the Moplah?",
	"What have you heard about Malabar?",  
	"What do you want to talk about?  Ask me anything!!",
	"Remember, you can't save the chat because you're not a supporter yet.  So leave this tab open.",
	
	"Ok, that's all for now.  Let's discuss this further perhaps next week or tonight over cocktails?  Non-alcoholic, of course.  Like maybe some soda pop or a salvia infustion.",
    "We will need to continue this later.  I must go now.  Sumimasen."

Prologue<br>
&#x1F4DC; Introduction<br><br>
There is a mighty man, still going strong in California, who has had many adventures and has transformed himself from poor farm boy from Iowa to multi-millionaire without even trying hard, or it would seem to a casual observer.  This book is a biography of Buddy, a true American hero who rose the ranks of the military and found riches.  Nobody every thought this ladies' man from a poor little town in Iowa would become a decorated officer in the armed services and well-loved at the bank and the stock broker's office.<br><br>
Buddy started off on a rural farm.  His upbringing was so quaint that nobody was even sure what day he was born.  Buddy was apparently born at home in the small rural farmhouse although nobody knows for sure or can remember.  In those days, things were different.  One room school houses, horses and buggies.  But, not too many horses.  This was around 1950 so people were mainly using automobiles to get around town.  However, Buddy grew up around horses, his family had a pair at one time until they were sold to raise funds.<br><br>
This biography is good for youngsters to read because people don't need to be poor and suffer.  No need to sleep on an empty stomach if you can learn from biographies like this one.  A true self-made man, pulled himself up all by himself with nobody's help really except his loving wife, friends, parents and church buddies.  So, if Buddy can do it, so can anybody.  With a little hard work and luck, any youngster can grow rich, but it genarally takes time.<br><br>

Buddy is doing well now, in his 80's.  A specimen of good health, lost weight recently.  Full head of hair.  Still has a great sense of humour.  So, even though Buddy worked hard, sometimes 3 jobs at a time, raised a big family, cared for an ill spouse and volunteered extensively, he still continues on with his good work in the community shaking hands and kissing babies.  He continues his gardening and goes out regularly with family.  He has a butler that lives with him, a trained black belt.  So, his security is sure.  And his butler also cooks for him so he eats well.<br><br>
What was Buddy's secret to make multi-million dollars and keep them?  How could he do that and make it look easy?  Read on to find out.  Buddy started as poor labourer then went to University where he excelled.  After leaving University, he joined war effort and later had a full career in non-military industry roles.  So, there is a lot to tell when it comes to the adventures of Buddy.  Names and places have been changed for privacy.  Buddy is well loved by all in the community he lives in and is know as a joker and someone who knows how to fix things and help people when they feel down and need someone to talk to.  His father was a caregiver and Buddy is also a two-time caregiver or more if you include all his volunteer work and babysitting roles.  Buddy cared for his ill father-in-law for years and his wife as well.  A true American hero!

<div id="chapone"></div>
Chapter One<br>
Early life<br><br>

Buddy (aka Buddy) was born in farm country to a pair of farmers, Edith and Glenn.  The two were very hard-working and Buddy was their second child.  The eldest was a boy, Franklin.  The second was Buddy.  Next, came several other including Ronaldo, Daniello, Karina and Denie.  So, it was quite a large family.  They lived in a farm in southeast Iowa near the home of John Wayne, famous cowboy film actor.   Buddy really loved John Wayne growing up and still does.  He has a large poster in his palacial Califonie mansion.<br><br>
Buddy spent his early childhood in Iowa on the farm.  There was no running water.  Just a cistern, well and outhouse.  The family raised animals such as rabbits, chickens, horses.  Buddy's father was from Nebraska but he left there and came to Iowa where he met Edith and married when the two were at a young age, just out of high school.  Glenn finished the sixth grade.  Edith graduated high school.  They settled in the Afton, Iowa area.  One funny story is this:  Glenn was busy at work one day when a man drove up to the modest farm house way out in the country and offered to buy the horses.  There were two of them.  Edith agreed and the horses were sold. This was not pleasing to Glenn.  Another story involved FDR and his farm rules.  Glenn was impacted by all the animal slaughters and other rules, it changed him.  He really loved animals and fish, and so he had no respect for FDR, the way he caused a great slaughter.  Glenn raised a lot of vegetables in a huge garden like rubarb, peas, beans.<br><br>

Glenn, Buddy's father, got a got working for a creamery - a popular occupation at the time.  Creameries hired many drivers to deliver milk.  And so, Glenn made a living for the family in the 1950's.  The family attended an LDS, Mormon church at the time in the area until one day when Buddy was in 5th grade or so and the family pulled up to the church parking lot in their vehicle and Edith or Glenn or both saw something they didn't like.  Perhaps it was dancing, or a girl showing her ankle.  Whatever it was, it really turned off Buddy's parents so they took off out of the LDS church, never to return.  They headed to the Lutheran church nearby and never looked back.  When the family arrived in their automobile at the Lutheran church, Buddy's older brother, Franklin, was already there, having a ball with the girlies.<br><br>
This was a point of consternation for a while between Buddy's parents because Edith's family was all LDS.  Not much is known of Glenn's family.  Nobody ever met them or saw them or heard their names!  But Buddy insists that they live in Nebraska and they are unfriendly alcoholics.  Buddy says that one time in the 1950's or so, the family drove out to Nebraska as was customary in those days on Sundays.  At that time, people would drop in on friends and relatives, go for a Sunday drive.  But, Nebraska is part of the West too, so it has some rough terrain, if you will.  It's not the Wild West anymore like it once was, like California is now, but still it apparently has some rough edges because Buddy and the family arrived at Glenn's relatives' home and were greeted with guns.  So, they didn't return much.<br><br>

Early in life, Buddy also went all the way to California, drove out with whole family to Yosemite Valley and visited everything in between Iowa and Yosemite on the way there and back.  Buddy really enjoyed this trip and it may have inspired his life-long love of travel and the travel industry.  Buddy was born with a very auspicious astrological chart.  He has a close-orb grand water trine and he has an aspect with Neptune.  Also, he is a 2nd decan Pisces, sidereal.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <div id="chaptwo"></div>
Chapter Two<br>
School Days<br><br>

Buddy went to a high school near Afton and was the most popular kid in school.  They called him The Roman because the ladies loved him and he was a star athlete, looked like a statue you would see in a museum.  His name is plastered all over Iowa, with records in his given sports.  If you go to gymnasiums and hallways, wherever records are kept, there is Buddy's name over and over again mostly around SW Iowa.  In high school Buddy often was seen with his best friend Geo.  They rode together to school and worked odd summer jobs together.  In Iowa, money is tight.  People have to work hard to make a living.  So, Buddy worked construction and labour position.  Buddy loves to tell the story of when he hung from the side of a building with a rope harness and used a jackhammer against a wall.  And another time, he helped build the big arch in St. Louis but all the fiberglass bothered him a bit, the skin was irritated.   But Buddy never quit.  He always stuck around to collect his paycheck, always early or on-time.  Rarely called in sick for work.  But, we're getting ahead of the story.  Let's return to Buddy's young days in Iowa.<br><br>

In high school, Buddy was highly sought after by the ladies.  However, he devoted himself to his studies and refused the many invitations to homecoming and prom dances, choosing instead to work in the laboratory on his experiments.  He was working to develop new types of tomatos which are blight resistant naturally, without gene-splicing or any far-out ideas like that.<br><br>

Buddy was determined to work in a field like biology because he loved tomato, onion, animals and outdoors.  He spent a lot of time in the field, birdwatching and collecting samples of animal footprints, scat, dead insects.  These he collected and labeled carefully, running chemical analysis experiments and writing up detailed reports.  This pattern of scientific devotion would serve his well later in life as his career soared in California private industry.<br><br>

In high school, one of the main sports Buddy did was track.  The wrestling coach and girls all begged him to join the wrestling team, but he was busy with American Football and track.  In football, he played defense.  He begged the coach to let him play offense too, because he was the best quarterback on the team, however, the coach did not want to run up the score too high on all the other teams and make them look bad.  This cost Buddy a scholarship for star QB to Univ. of Iowa.  Instead, Buddy was star defense end like Lawrence Taylor.  Opposing teams feared the day they would come to Afton, they knew it was impossible to lose by less than 28 points.<br><br>
On the track team, they called him The Roman.  The ladies never used to come to the football games, too cold and lots of mosquitos.  However, once Buddy started playing for the Wildcats (that was the mascot), attendance soared and there was a large number of female fans.  Of course, at the same time, the team suddenly started winning, going undefeated in the regular season with Buddy causing many turnovers.  When he played football, the coach would take all the team out to eat the night before the game.  They would go to a vegetarian restaurant and the coach would pay.  The coach said it was important that all the kids have the right vitamins for the game, so they would eat a lot of corn like corn on cob, corn biscuits, cornbread, polenta, vegetables breaded with cornmeal and oven friend in soybean oil.<br><br>
Thus, Buddy continued to excel in high school.  His family left the farm while he was around 6th grade and moved to a big huge house in the best part of a little town.  It was next to a lake and on the edge of town, perfect.  Buddy continued his studies in town and enjoyed going to Dairy Queen for treats  There was a movie theater, shops, sports store, a drag.  So, Buddy enjoyed his time at the jr. high school and high school as well.  He received high marks but was best known for sports prowess.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div id="chap3"></div>
Chapter Three<br>
Big Man On Campus<br><br>

After graduating high school with honours, Buddy continued his course of work at a junior college in SW Iowa and then proceeded to Iowa State University where he majored in Fish and Wildlife.  He had a passion for animals and wanted to work against poaching.  But at the university, the ladies were constantly begging Buddy for dates and tutoring and this impacted his grades so eventually he left the university after meeting his future wife to join the war effort.  His fiance was very patriotic and was taken by the recruiting mottos and hype, so she convinced Buddy to join up.  He wanted to join Marines or Army but his dear mother, Edith, convinced him to join Navy instead because she didn't want Buddy to get injured or killed in line of duty.<br><br> 

By this time, Buddy's mom had been confined to a wheelchair, no longer able to walk or move arms, hands.  She could talk a bit.  This happened after she received a polio vaccine.  Her symptoms were attributed to polio but many thought it could have been the polio vaccine.  This caused Buddy to worry constantly and buy his dear mother many gifts which dampered his budget temporarily.  Of course, once everyone found out that Buddy was leaving Ames to join the armed services and fight in the Vietnam War, there was a general hue and outcry.  Some students were patriotic and glad Buddy was following his heart.  Other students were not anti-war but they were very upset that Buddy was leaving Ames, Iowa and would be in harm's way on the frontlines of a bloody war.<br><br>
All this was happening when one day a knock came at his dorm room.  Buddy answered and saw the woman of his dreams, Karina.  She was a brunette, very attractive, outgoing.  She was wearing a poodle skirt and a nice blouse with sweater.  Karina was there to meet Buddy's roommate, Red.  However, Red was out at the time of her visit and the two, Karina and Buddy, fell madly in love.  From that point on they were often seen together and had many outings.<br><br>

Karina was from the finest suburb north of Chicago.  Her family is Hollywood royalty.  Two of her first cousins are very famous movie and tv actors.  She was very rich, of course.  She passed away around 2015 from natural causes.  She was born in sidereal leo, first decan, and her personality was very artistic and outgoing.  She had blue eyes and curly hair.  5'4", 115 lbs.  Many guys asked her out constantly but she was madly in love with Buddy.  Karina worked on campus of ISU as a soda-jerk and she met a prostitute who worked at the cafe.  Karina went to Guatemala with the prostitute to meet her family and see the country.  She never lost her love for spanish food after that trip, often cooking up vegetarian tacos in buffet style.<br><br>
Karina's mother was a nurse in Chicago at a hospital and that's where she met Karina's father, the son of a Danish immigrant.  Karina's grandparents were American (two of them) and the others were Danish and Norweigen.  Karina grew up with her maternal grandmother and parents along with brother on a large 5 acre estate with multiple homes in the best suburb of Chicago at that time, up to the north a wee bit from downtown.  Karina's father did not fight in the wars but he did work in the mills to support war effort even though he took a stand against the firebombings and nuke attacks.  Her father was named Gilberto and he worked in furniture sales at Marshall Field's Department Store.  He too the train to work rather than pollute the air because at that time the fuel was heavily leaded and the air was thick with lead.  Nowadays, the fuel is unleaded which means no lead added but there's still some land and other dangerous pollutants in gasoline so we must all drive Teslas and Ford e-bikes when possible.<br><br>

When Karina found out that Buddy was going to leave ISU and join the armed services, she was at work (the campus cafe).  Karina immediately made plans to follow him and transfer her coursework to a college near his base assignment.   She went to see her advisor and planned to transfer her subjects and credits to a new suitable college with a matching course (computer science and home economics minor). The couple married in early December (3rd face Scorpio whole sign Hauser - Orphiuchus) and Buddy travelled the world as a high ranking enlisted man before achieving the ranks of NCO.  Buddy spent a lot of time in Japan and many other continents like Europe.  He worked for the intelligence service.  Nobody ever thought he would become a multi-millionaire because he was very unassuming and told a lot of jokes as is common in Iowa.  Another thing that happens in Iowa is this:  At Halloween the kids go trick and treating.  But the children are often required to tell jokes before they receive the candy.  And if they do not have a joke they may be teased a bit but Buddy always strove against teasing and such dirty tricks, he preferred to simply hand out the candy no questions asked.  Later in life, after Buddy had amassed his first 500k, he would sit on the front porch of his palacial estate and wait for the trickersters to arrive demanding candy.<br><br>

Buddy would wear a scary rubber mask and then jump out of his hiding place and scare the kids each Halloween on the porch.  It was a tradition the children looked forward to each year.  But one year the estate was lightly egged and Buddy took it personally, perhaps wrongly concluding that the egging was a result of the mask charades.  However, little did Buddy know, the egging was unrelated to his prants, rather the likely cause was his daughter's missteps.  Nevertheless, the incident took a toll on poor Buddy and he never again donned the mask of horrow, fearing retribution from scared Kinder.<br><br>

<div id="chap4"></div>
Chapter Vier<br>
Der Vietnam War<br><br>

Karina followed him all over the world but she mainly stayed in the USA on base and off-base.  The two moved to Denver, Washington, Alameda and several other locations before landing in Hillsborough, California area.  They rented a place south of Hillsborough and lived there for a short time before buying a huge mansion house in San Mateo County.  Buddy went to asia and fought the war and the kids stayed in California.  The couple lived in Fruitvale, Oakland for awhile and volunteered around the area, helping people from church with household chores.  Buddy was a wiz around a wrench, knew how to fix all kinds of appliances and vehicles.  So, it was natural for him to help out at church cutting grass and helping old ladies at their modest homes in Oakland.<br><br>
When Karina married Buddy, an Iowa farm boy, her parents (city slickers from one of the biggest cities in America) had reservations.  Karina's mother seemed pleased, after all, Karina had not attended prom or homecoming.  And Karina's mother Dora worried about her sometimes.  Her father was a sidereal capricorn (1st face) sun sign.    So, he was a successful salesman and outgoing at times, like for his career and later in life when he lived at The Sequoias in Portola Valley.  However, at home and with family he was more reserved.<br><br>

Buddy was out fighting the war, travelling about asia but Karina was left at home all by herself and that's when she started meeting church friends and going to more church events like bible studies.  The war was unpopular so Karina and Buddy were not heralded in the community.  Rather, they had to not wear uniforms too much or fly flag because they did not want to provoke their neighbors in East Oakland or the ghetto in San Mateo County, once they moved there.<br><br>
So, the war dragged on for many years and Buddy wasn't injured.  He was fine but emotionally, the war took a toll on both sides.  After the war, Buddy found work with Pan American World Airways and went to New York City for training.  After that, he returned to San Francisco and worked downtown for many years while staying in the service part-time.  This is a story of rags to riches, but at this point in the story, it's mostly rags.  Karina, although she grew up in the finest suburb of Chicago, was born to a thrift father and grandmother so she did not know luxury.  Buddy was born into a poor farm family and barely had food to eat, not because of his father's fault, but just because the family was so big and his brothers were hungry.  There's never enough food or supplies for a family like that.  Even if Buddy's father was a millionaire, there would have been shortages in such a big family because just think of when you go shopping at local mom and pop store with a little kid.  What do they always want to do?  They will want to buy every single thing in the store.  So, you have to tell them, "No."  So, Buddy grew up wanting as many do all around the world.  However, Buddy became a multi-millionaire.  What was his secret?<br><br>
During the war, Buddy spent a lot of time in Hawaii and so Hawaii 5-0 and other Hawaii television shows were always Buddy's favorites along with many other shows like Charlie Sheen's comedies and Duck Dynasty.  He wore several different uniform colours during the war and steadily made his way up the ranks.  His uniforms were black, white and beige.  He had a jet black moustache and thick black head of hair.  He was always ready with a joke, a true Iowan in that comedian style.  Buddy never flinched when gunfire went off or when there was an air raid or a tornado.  He had nerves of steel.<br><br>

<div id="chap5"></div>
Chapter Five<br>
Post-War Period<br><br>
After the war, Buddy had a few kids and so he was looking for a larger nest.  At the time he was stationed at Alameda and did work also at Treasure Island.  His wife found a place in the ghetto part of San Mateo County near Atherton.  It was a rental, a step up from their existence in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood.<br><br>
