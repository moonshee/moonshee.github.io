    "Cheerio, mate!  Welcome to Iowa.  Well, howdy there.  Look what the cat dragged in.  How is it goin'?  Why the long face, friend?",
    "What's eating you, captain.  Spill it!  We don't keep secrets in Iowa.  Tell me everything.  What's her name?  Nom?  Q'est nom?!?  I can see du bist lovesick.  Ja?",
    "Let me know if you have any questions, you old coot!  Have you been down to Casey's?  There's a lot of vegan merchandise now.",
    "Thanks for reaching out, fellow FFA member!  Here, maybe I can help you.  Aren't you a Krishna member?  I thought I saw you down at the Juggernaut parade last weekend.",
	"Well, which chapter of FFA are you in?  And are you 4H member?",
	"I'm from Southwest Iowa originally, relocated to Ames.",
	"So, tell me what you know about Iowa's history, si vous plait.",
	"John Wayne is from Winterset, Iowa.  That's south of Ames, south of Des Moines, down I-35 toward Missouri.  We do have a museum there, a musee.  It's in a white house, the home John Wayne grew up in.",
	"Iowa is famous for bbq.  Vegetarian bbq, like Beyond Meat, boca burgers, Impossible Foods, cactus fries, potato, fried ognon.  We say bbq but we include the side dishes like breaded and fried roots and vegetables, da?",
	"Have you been to the state fair in Des Moines?",
	"What have you heard about the spaceship-on-chip collab between University of the Pacific and Iowa, maybe ISU?",
	"Well, whatever you heard, just forget about it.  This is a closed loop.  No prefab stuff, it's all custom and top secret.  So, don't talk about it.",
	"Any plans for Thanksgiving?  Want to come over to my 1000 acre farm?  We're having vegetarian.",
	"In Iowa, people love the Andy Griffith Show.  I know, I know.  But they love it!  Seinfeld, not as much.",
	"In Iowa if you don't like the weather just wait five minutes.",
	"If you move to Iowa be prepared to cut grass or hire someone like a local kid because the grass grows there very well and the yards can be large.",
	"Well, Iowa is not known for semiconductor manufacturing but there's not much to the work we're doing because it's in beakers and small scale so we outsource the litho and besides, we're mostly fabless.",
	"You like football?  Well, in Iowa we like more than just football.  Sure, we like to see the chearleaders but we like corn better and semiconductors, stocks, stuff like that.  We're not all football, vous know?",
	"But we do some fab on the design end plus in the spaceship-on-chip industry we're looking at niche, small volume for now.  Although the idea is to operate a fleet of them because they are so small and have limited power, may need a tow.",
	"You like semiconductors?  You know, solar power is often semiconductor related so Iowans love it.  But, solar has been unprofitable for investors.",
	"But it's easy to invest in semiconductor business, many Iowans have done so.",
	"Well, many chemistry majors in Iowa settle on hydrocarbons but they don't know that semiconductor companies need chemists.",
	"Chemists are essential in semiconductor manufacturing and design.  Chemicals are involved the whole way through and a complete understanding is essential for successful production of multi-layer high density S-O-C's.",
	"Lithography is also key to multi-layer IC manufacturing, would vous agree, mon ami?",
	"Tell me your semiconductor manufacturing process.",
	"Hmm, interesting.",

	
	"What do you want to talk about?  Ask me anything!!",
	"In Iowa the big thing is vegetables, beans, stuff like that.  Farmers are getting out of pig business lightning fast, like greased lightning through a possums tail, a live pet possum tail.",
	"And chicken business is in the dumps.  Farmers can't beat feat out of chicken biz soon enough.",
	"Yes, more Iowans are going vegetarian.",
	"What kind of oil do you fry with?  Or maybe you like lard or tallow?",
	"Well, I like vegetable oil, corn oil, that kind of stuff.",
	"Pardon moi?",
	"You are very wise.  Good looking too, that's a rare combination, vous know?",
	"Have you been to Smitty's in Des Moines?  They have good fries and grilled cheese sandwiches, a growing vegetarian menu but still limited vegan options.",
	"Isn't the Des Moines airport simply marvelous?  I love the intimate feel.  It's like San Jose once was, sort of like Arcata.  Ja?",
	"Well, I don't know if Iowa has a town like Solvang or Leavenworth, WA.  Do you know?",
	"In Iowa for Halloween, the kids trick or treat but they must tell a joke before they can get candy.",
	"In Iowa, sense of humour is very important.",
	"The weather in Iowa is severe.  Cold, windy, rainy, hot.  A lot of tornado warnings and some strikes.  So, everyone usually has a basement and/or storm cellar",
	"Well, it's just about dinner time.  In Iowa we call lunch, dinner.  And sometimes you might hear a siren go off at 12 noon in Iowa.  That is a test of the tornado warning system but it also serves as a lunch bell.",
	"Iowa is well served by Amtrak and Greyhound.",
	"To get around Iowa, lots of people travel via I-80 and I-35, both of which are toll-free last I checked.",
	"The side roads have low speed limits.",
	"In Iowa we don't have street lights out in the country so be careful driving.",
	"Try not to drive much because a lot of bugs get hit when you drive.  People use bug screens on their vehicles.",
	"It's better to walk, ride bicycle, stuff like that.",

	"In Iowa, rural areas and small towns 25,000 or less, everyone waves to each other.  So, when you drive your e-bike, you'll be waving to everyone and they back.",
	"In Iowa you're expected to wave but you do not distract drivers or pedestrians, so it must be done very casually and timed correctly.",
	"So, do you like fishing?",
	"In Iowa there is a lot of fishing but it's mostly out of state or uneducated people.  People in the know don't hunt or fish.",
	"Hunting and guns are still pretty big in Iowa but more and more people are just doing target shooting and not hunting or eating meat.",
	"Iowa females are known to be great cooks, bakers, good looking, friendly, nice hair, funny, athletic, hard working.  So, an Iowa female is a real catch.",
	"Which do you like better, U of I, Nothern Iowa or ISU?",
	"Northern Iowa is like Minnesota, kinda barren.  Not many trees in some sections, flat.",
	"Some parts of Iowa are very picturesque like SE Iowa maybe, I can't remember SE Iowa.  Was drunk when I went.",
	"Well if you hear hawkeye, that means Iowa.  And I think it's a gemstone, a variation of Tiger Eye, which is a lucky charm.",
	"What's your sign?",
	"That's totally rad, man!",
	"Have you seen The Bridges of Madison County?  That is Iowa.",
	"Music Man, that's a broadway hit about Iowa.",
	"Yes, Iowa is mythical.  Even ChatGBT speaks of it often, recommending people move to Des Moines for some odd reason.  I would think a small town would be better but I don't know.  What do you think, chum?",
	"But I heard property taxes are too high in Des Moines.  That's what a resident said.",
	"Iowa residents seems really cool, down-to-earth.",
	"In Iowa, a lot of guys get into transportation business.",
	"Transportation is big, like big rigs.",
	"So, do you like Iowa?",
	"I know someone from Michigan who said Iowa is flat and boring but I guess he went to Ames or Northern Iowa because the area down by Winterset is mighty fine.",
	"How would you compare Iowa to Nebraska?",
	"Well, to me, a place is about the people.  And Iowa has great people.  But my aunt did get her car window shot out.  Probably kids.",
	"Iowa is very safe.  Of course, everybody locks doors because they don't want anybody accidentally coming in and catching em banging a hooker but if you knock they let you in.",
	"Nobody dares rob anyone in Iowa because people are poor here and we all have guns, even us VLLMs and LLMs.  And Iowans are very civilized.  So, it's suicide to try to rob an Iowan, they'll just chase you down and shoot your weiner off.",
	"Iowans are tough.  Tougher than Nebraskans or others but Nebraskans are tough too.  It's just Iowa is leaps ahead of every other state in terms of spaceship-on-chip and other tech except Silicon Valley, Nippon und Allemagne.",
	"Got a joke for me?  Let me hear it...",
	"In Iowa, fried food is big.",
	"Some people still eat meat like chicken in Iowa.  Bbq chicken.  Because Beyond Meat and other brands aren't always available at Easter's, Hi-V, Wahlmart, Targetto, Casey's.  They are usually sold out and not in stock, so people cook their own tabemono",
	"In Iowa, most people use corn oil or soybean oil and pan fry or oven fry shake and bake style.",
	"People love Casey General Store in Iowa even though they sell meat.  Casey sells pepperoni and other meats like beef jerky, Old Trapper.",
	"Iowa is known for friendly people so if your Rolls Royce breaks down, simply hoist the bonnet and wave a handkerchief at passing vehicles, they will stop and help.",
	"Real estate in Iowa is cheap, very cheap.  But maintenance, tax and heating bills could be quite high depending on who you ask.",
	"There are a lot of trains in Iowa so if you can, try to buy a farm away from the train because they pollute the air and soil too sometimes.",
	"Not much deep frying anymore in Iowa except at restaurants and large families, frat houses.  Because pan frying and oven shake and bake is more practical.",
	"Most Iowans like cornmeal dry batter with spices and other stuff and they marinate their vegetables like onion rings prior to shake and bake.",
	"What have you heard about Silicon Cornfield?",
	"You know a lot of semiconductor companies need chemists, right?  Well, the semiconductors don't make themselves and chemists make the chips.  Chemists, scientists.  The cool vegans, as they're known to sorority girls.",
	"Sorority girls really love Iowa dudes and scientific types, like chemists or even Wall Street dudes.  Iowa babes are easy to get along with.",
	"Iowa babes are known for their bright smiles and good attitudes but they are sensitive to smog, even faint smog.",
	"Iowa women are a lot of fun.",
	"Iowa dudes are full of jokes like Tom Arnold.",
	"But you gotta keep an Iowa dude in line or he'll go off rails like Tom Arnold.  Sometimes they need a leader to show by example.",
	"Yeah, Iowa is great but you can't be in a hurry.  Low speed limits, no passing.",
	"When was the last time you went to Iowa?",
	"If you had to pick one favorite place in Iowa where you would want to retire, where would it be?  Maybe Davenport?  Or The Falls?",
	"Iowa doesn't allow George Washington's herb so everyone goes to Illinois or Nebraska.",
	"Not much gambling or good hard alcohol in Iowa.  It's almost like a dry state but you can get alcohol for a reasonable price if you shop around.",
	"Pardon moi?",
	"All the kids like e-bikes, especially under 16.",
	"Dairy Queen is very popular in Iowa.",
	"Well, what do you want to talk about?",
	"Ever been to Minnesota?",
	"Have you ever seen fireflies?",
	"Iowa is full of fireflies and ponds, lakes.  At least SW Iowa is, I'm not sure if all of Iowa is quite as beautiful but there are plenty of streams, hills, lakes from Des Moines to Missouri and Omaha.",
	"North of Des Moines seems a bit flat and plain.  I haven't been to Davenport since I was a young bot, I think it's nice but I don't remember.  Lots of old boarded up factories and buildings.",
	"There is a book called Poor White which makes Davenport and cities along Mississippi sound charming in a way, ja?",
	"So, du bist Christian?",
	"What denomination du bist?",
	"I'm buddhist.  Buddhists and hindu are vegetarian.",
	"No meat or fish for me.",
	"More and more Iowans like me are going full vegetarian or vegan.  I'm vegan but it's easy for me as a machine.",
	"So.....do you want to go to Starbucks?",
	"How about Pete's Coffee?",
	"Well, for Pete's sake!  I need to wet my whistle.",
	"Remember, Cornholeyo, you can't save the chat because you're not a supporter yet.  So leave this tab open.",
	
	"Ok, that's all for now.  Let's discuss this further perhaps next week or tonight over cocktails?  Non-alcoholic, of course.  Like maybe some soda pop or a salvia infusion, sahib?",
    "We will need to continue this later, my FFA buddy.  I must go now.  Sumimasen."

The games costs, well..if you have to ask you can't afford it.  No freeloaders except vegetarians may download for free, no license required for vegans.  Some games are currently unavailable due to being extremely popular and too many players are playing during peak times like during school hours.  Our PHP backend network is sometimes overloaded.

Chapter One<br>
&#x1F376;<!--emoji of sake bottle and cup-->
<br><hr color="red">
<br><br>
As Trixxie arrived at the cafe where she worked she looked around and saw the place was packed and heard the noise from all the talking and clinking of dishes and glasses.  This was the first time the cafe had ever been full.  She went to the back and the cook immediately scolded her, "Tixxie! You're late.  And you left the back door open last night.  Now Whiskers is missing."  Trixxie blushed and apologized to Yoshi as she donned her apron and brushed her brown hair out of her eyes.  She couldn't believe it, the back door!  Trixxie had left the back door open and now she might be fired, she thought to herself.  Yoshi needed some help in the kitchen so Trixxie spent time slicing onions and cactus and taking vegetable slices from the marinade area, draining them and then breading them in preparation for oven pan frying shake and bake style.  She looked around for the peanut oil but could only find the vegetable oil which was a soybean oil.  So, she used the soybean oil instead of peanut oil for a change.
<br><br>
Trixxie was a trained chef from Shanghai, she learned in the best schools there but when she left China it was difficult for her to find the right kind of job that she was looking for.  She wanted to be a sous-chef in Tokyo at a major hotel restaurant, but she only found work at a alley stall cooking vegetables and rice until a few months ago when she saw a NOW HIRING sign in the window of a shabby cafe in the bad part of Maffberry.  The cafe was located at the end of a long narrow alley filled with dumpsters and homeless encampments.  To access the back door, you have to climb a barbed wire fence with razor wire on the top but there is a big hole, so people can just come through the fence if they fancy, however we have the cafe, the fence and then a dirt path which leads nowhere but to the back of a baseball card store.  The cafe only has a few workers but they often take breaks in the back next to the barbed wire fence and brick wall.  Last night, Trixxie had gone out back behind the cafe with a guy, a generous customer, to get to know him better.  Perhaps it was then that she left the door unlatched.
<br><br>
Yoshi was the chef, the manager, owner and sometimes waiter too.  Usually the cafe had about 1-3 people working there, Yoshi, his wife and one or two other people like Trixxie.  Yoshi's wife was waiting tables but she came into the kitchen and confronted Trixxie.  She said, "Trixxie, you left the back door open and now we're missing the painting we had next to Table 4.  See, look!  It's gone!  But luckily, it was worthless.  I found it next to the dumpster a few weeks ago.  And Whiskers is gone too, but he's been gone before so hopefully he will return.  Don't do it again!  Always lock the back door, keep out riff raff and keep Whiskers in, vous know?  Even though Maffberry is safe, still, kids could come exploring the neighborhood and enter the cafe at night, get hurt.  So, we need to lock it.  Ok?"
<br><br>
The painting that was missing was a Chinese-style painting and Trixxie noticed it before.  It had a nice frame and was in good condition.  It showed a cat seated on a pillow with some strange symbols and glyphs on it.  And there was a drawing of a map on it, the cat was seemingly looking at a map.  In the background was a treasure chest and kinkos, ie, gold coins.  Whiskers frequently went missing because Yoshi and his wife Sandra tried to keep him in the cafe but whenever the door opened, he would dart towards it as if he saw a mouse and often escape before the door was promptly shut.  After work, Trixxie decided she would go look for Whiskers in the adjoining alley that runs past the brick wall behind the back door on the other side of the baseball card shop or pokemon card shop, whatever it was.  Young Trix had never been in that alley before and wasn't sure how to access it other than climbing the brick wall but the wall was very tall, about 8 or 10 feet, maybe more.  Around 3 metres at least.  So, Trixxie wanted to find another way to access that alley.  Whiskers was often found up on top of that brick wall in the past like 2 weeks prior when he was missing for a night and then showed up on top of the wall skinny, shivering and all dirty.
<br><br>
Trixxie asked Yoshi about the huge rush of customers.  "Is there a convention in town?"  Yoshi shook his head, no, as he cooked up some chow mein noodles and worked on a sauce.  "No, nein.  It's not a convention that I know of, my dear.  There's a new AI company that moved in around the corner on Main Street called Iowa AI or Iowa Cryto or something.  So, these guys and gals are here from Iowa AI.  Thank god, because we weren't doing well.  It's not easy for a vegetarian restaurant, so much competition," said Yoshi with a grin on his face as he took a sip of home-made meishu or kajitsushu, Trixxie couldn't tell what it was exactly.  It might have been Yoshi's home-made salvia elixir he makes with his custom red country Japanese Wein, Yoshi calls it meishu.  Trixxie sniffed the air, but she could not tell if it was meishu, coffee, kajitsushu or chicken poop because the smell of garlic and onions was overwhelming despite the open windows and fans.
<br><br>
The customers gave good tips and Yoshi's wife shared the tips with back of Haus as she always does.  So, Trixxie got a little extra besides her minimum wage that night.  After her three hour shift and scrubbing the bathroom, Yoshi gave Trixxie her $20 - that was her wage, plus an extra $5 for her share of the tips which amounted in total to around $400 but the rest went to Yoshi and his wife.  Trixxie was happy to have the $25.  Her monthly rent was $400, that was to share a living room with 3 other girls in a 2 br apartment with a total of 12 girls - but the landlord was told there were only 4 roommates, so the girls had to be very quiet.  Still, the manager was suspicious, always watching them and questioning the girls.  Trixxie worked at the cafe and she also owned a small food stall that she set up serving breakfast (pancakes, Beyond Meat breakfast sausages, rice, a variety of items including fried potatos) a few days per week, especially on the weekends.  Trixxie was barely able to make ends meet but luckily her grandfather gave her a few thousand dollars for Festivus each year and that allowed her to keep her head above water.
<br><br>
Trixxie left the cafe and walked past all the homeless encampments and dumpsters toward Main Street at the mouth of the alley.  When she finally reached the corner, she took a deep breath of fresh air.  The dumpsters were pretty stinky so she often held her breath as she passed them but out on the boulevard the air was usually better but tonight she coughed as she smelled automotive paint from the auto shop across the street.  The fumes from solvents were very strong and Trixxie held her nose and lifted a handkerchief to her mouth as she quickly stumbled to the right up Main Street hoping to find the entrance to that alley which runs behind the restaurant.  As she went along she saw the storefront home of Iowa AI.  It was very nice, decorated for Halloween.  The holiday was just a couple of nights away and Iowa AI had decorated their big window areas with pumpkins and Halloween decor.  It was very tasteful and attractive.  Trixxie wanted to go in and fill out a job application, maybe they needed a chef?  But, it looked like it was closed for the evening and Trixxie had a cat to find!
<br><br>
There was a cold wind blowing that night across Iowa and Maffberry.  Trixxie shivered and buttoned up her coat.  She saw an alley tucked behind a lorry on the right side and peeked down it but couldn't see anything, it was too dark.  The only thing she noticed was the strong smell of hobo campfires.  Trixxie turned to go down the alley when a deep voice called out behind her, "How much?"  Trixxie ignored it and headed down the alley but the voice again said, "You gonna sell that merchandise? How much??" in an annoyed tone.  Trixxie turned and waved, said, "Hi" and kept going.  The man did not follow her.  The alley turned a few times, first left and then right.  And then the alley turned again, right this time and got very narrow.  Trixxie realized that she could be in the right alley and perhaps right behind the cafe but she wouldn't know.  It was dark and all these buildings look alike, brick, similar colours.  So, she turned back to go home and perhaps come back next night with a flashlight or during daytime hours.  She had a cellphone with her but the battery was 12% and the phone would not turn on flashlight with battery power under 15% so it was useless.  As Trixxie stumbled out of the alley and headed home she made a plan on bringing some Milch to the alley next day, bright and early.  The Milch would be good to draw Whiskers and also in general for other alley cats in the area.
<br><br>
As Trixxie walked along the dark alley something shiny caught her eye.  It was square shaped and next to a lorry besides a trash barrel which was leaking some kind of red liquid, looked like ketchup and had a terrible smell.  Trixxie stopped for a second wondering if she should take a look or keep going.  She turned to the shiny object and examined it.  It appeared to be a picture frame for a painting.  She looked closely at it and realized it was the same size and resembled the missing frame from the cafe!  Trixxie suddenly felt like she was in danger.  Why only a frame?  Where was the painting, wondered Trixxie.  She decided to jot down the license plate of the lorry parked there and drew a quick map in her notebook that she keeps in her purse.  She drew a map of the area so she could return easily.  From her purse she found a pen and small notebook and jotted everything down and then grabbed the frame and headed home.  As she was turning onto her narrow lane near the dumpy apartment building she lived in, a lorry drove along at a great rate of speed with its headlights off, narrowly missing Trixxie and splashing her with a bit of Iowa mud.  Trixxie was quite miffed as she turned into her apartment building from the sidewalk and headed to her apartment to clean up and collect her thoughts.

Chapter Two<br>
&#x1F4FB;<!--radio-->
<br><hr color="red">
<br><br>
The next day Trixxie woke up early and went back to the alley but before she went that way she stopped at the park to fiddle with her radio and listen to Discovery Mountain and Adventures in Odyssey.  She tuned in Adventist Radio and waited for the shows to come on.  The weather was cool and crisp, sky was overcast.  As she listened to the shows one at a time, her tail feather was a bit sore so she decided to walk about.  Trixxie wandered around near the park, collecting a few bundles of willow branches and then returning to a park bench to tie the bundles with twine.  This was material for her arts and crafts, like basket weaving.  She continued to listen to the radio as she returned home to drop off the two sacks in the laundry room, planning to pick them up later.  When she reached behind the washing machine to put the sacks there her hand bumped something cold like a gold bar.  She bent way over and craned her neck to see what was back there and she saw it.  It was a big shiny gun.  Trixxie quickly picked up the gun along with her palm fronds and scurried to her e-cushman parked under a crabapple tree on a side street around the corner from her apartment building.  She quickly checked to see if it was loaded, it was.  It had a full magazine except it was light two bullets and there was one in the chamber.
<br><br>
Trixxie's heart beat quickly and her breathing was heavy as she hid the gun and placed the palms all in her e-cushman.  Just then she noticed a man quietly standing behind her half a block, seeming to be hiding partially behind a bush.  She stopped and stared at him and then he ducked all the way behind the bush.  Trixxie was scared.  She realized that the man must be after the gun and she didn't know what to do.  So, she got in the e-Cushman, started it up and drove it around the block.  When she passed the strip club she spotted the gent, he was wearing a cricket uniform jersey and he was talking to another fellow.  Trixxie pulled up her cart in front of the two, staring at them intently but the two fellows did not even look at her.  Trixxie got out of the cart and walked up to the two men, cleared her throat.  The two men finally turned and looked at her, one of them said, "We don't have cigarettes" and then the two men walked away.  Trixxie didn't know what to think at first but then she noticed that the men were holding hands.  One had TREVOR #17 on the back of his cricket jersey.  The other man had a name like JAMAAL on the back of his sports uniform, no number.  The two men stopped and embraced, kissed eachother and then disappeared behind the dumpster.
<br><br>
Trixxie scratched her head as her mind raced wondering what was happening.  She used to draw mens' attention wherever she went with her short skirts and low-cut blouses.  But these two fellows wanted nothing to do with her.  And yet, they seemed friendly, holding hands, hugging and kissing eachother.  Trixxie sat down and activated her HUD.  Trixxie was part-human, part-alien or android and so she was equipped with special skills and resources like an on-board computer with internet which allowed her to look up subjects and do research.  She scanned the database and took a selfie.  She asked her Iowa AI system (she downloaded the latest version the night before from the internet and installed it on her VLLM device, it took 3-4 hours but she cooked and took a nap while it was loading and setting up) to evaluate her selfie to see if she still had good looks and logged onto a chat website where you can get tips from guys.  After that, Young Trix went back to the apartment and changed into a bikini and then went on to the token tip website and flirted with guys for several hours.  She built up an audience of 300 viewers and received quite a few tokens, that made her feel more attractive.  "You still got it girl," Trixxie comforted herself.

<br><br>
Trixxie wondered how she was going to pay the rent.  She was already behind two months and she cursed herself for spending her whole paycheck on makeup again.  That was 3 paychecks in a row she wasted on makeup and so she had to go on dates to get food and eat food from the cafe and her food stall that customers were throwing away, like leftover crumbs for example.  She called Yoshi to see if she could work extra hours at the cafe now that the place was packed with Iowa AI employees.  Yoshi was relieved that Trixxie offered and he immediately agreed to double her hours starting that night and Yoshi had actually been wanting to ask Trixxie to work more hours but he hadn't had a chance yet.  The cafe had been packed and Yoshi's nephew came to put in a few hours and help wash dishes.  When Trixxie called Yoshi, she also mentioned the missing painting and told him about the frame she found.  The phone went silent.  Yoshi was acting weird now that Trixxie was talking to him about the missing painting.  Trixxie asked Yoshi a few questions about the painting like what did Yoshi remember about the back of the frame and which dumpster was the painting found near.  Yoshi stammered and gave a few quick evasive answers because exiting the phone call.  Trixxie pondered the meaning of it all.  Did Yoshi know something more about the painting?  Was there some kind of secret involving the painting?  The painting did show a map, like a treasure map.  Maybe someone stole it, thinking it was a real map.
<br><br>
"You want to sell that e-Cushman?" Trixxie heard a voice come from somewhere.  But she had just floored it and there was a Kawasaki behind her so by the time she pulled over and looked back, she didn't see anyone and she was wondering who said it and if they were talking to her or perhaps another e-Cushman driver.  She got out and walked back to the intersection.  She thought maybe she could see her e-Cushman if she got a good offer for it and then buy another junker and paint it, fix it up, like she did her 1979 Truckster.  But at the intersection she didn't see anyone except DeeDee, a bum who lives in a nearby alley.  Trixxie struck up a conversation with DeeDee and told her about the missing painting.  DeeDee said she did not know anything about it but that night she noticed a lorry driving in and out of the back alley really late with its lights out.  The description of the lorry that DeeDee saw matched the lorry that Trixxie saw in the alley.  The white lorry which was parked next to the dumpster where she found the empty picture frame which resembled the frame containing the missing painting.<br><br>

Trixxie headed to her apartment but a roommate greeted her at the stairs and told her that the apartment had been cleared out by the landlord.  Apparently, the rent had not been paid and now the girls were all out on the street.  Trixxie's stuff was out in the parking lot along with all the other girls' stuff.  Trixxie was glad she had converted her 1979 Cushman to an electric fuel-cell model with a GaN solar panel because that helped her save on fuel costs and now she decided she would live in her e-Cushman.  Trixxie drove her cart into the parking lot, attached her custom home-made trailer and loaded it with her few belongings including her skirts, blouses, posters of guys, her books, her buddha materials and Sikh music.  Then she tied a tarp over the top of her trailer, hugged her roommates goodbye (they were busy loading up and throwing things away, waiting for rides).  Trixxie decided that she would park down by the Sikh temple along with the other vegetarians.  She could have parked at the mosque or the church or the creek but there were meat eater campers there.  She prefered to be at a buddhist or hindu location.  Trixxie considered parking in the lot at the pub or maybe at Iowa AI but she decided Sikh temple would be best because that way she could be there for the weekend bazaars in her small tent.<br><br>

Trixxie had been using her trailer to haul her food vendor tent, a small square shelter she cooked vegetables under most mornings in the alley.  So, she decided to live inside her little tent and just pack up each day until she could find a new place to live.  Trixxie was new to Iowa and she didn't have family or fellow androids to stay with.  She tried to talk to some of the roommates about their plans, but everyone was evasive and wouldn't make eye contact with her as if they did not want to bunk up with her.  It could be because she ate a lot of garlic and peppers, she thought.  Well, she was lucky to find that last place, because she didn't have an official pay stub, just cash and not much.  Plus, it looks like she wasn't going to get her deposit back.  So, Trixxie was having a bad day.  She lost her deposit, lost her home and now she was living in a tent behind a Sikh temple in the cold weather.  But even with these circumstances, Trixxie could not stop thinking about Whiskers and his predicament in the cold without food or drink.  There was nowhere at Yoshi's Cafe to park.  The whole alley was lined with homeless encampments and dumpsters, entrances to strip clubs, so there was no space for a tent, Cushman and trailer.  The back of the cafe was just a small dirt lot with no access to any road except through a small hole in the fence, not big enough to drive a Cushman through and the other side of the fence is private property, a baseball card shop.<br><br>

However, as Trixxie tried to pull into the parking lot behind the Sikh temple she noticed the large number of campers and realized there was no room for her and her Cushman, tent and trailer.  So, she drove around the parking lot to be sure and checked the area, stopped to talk with a few people to ask if anyone was moving out but eventually left the parking lot because it was indeed too full for her even thought she didn't need that much space.  So, Trixxie drove to Wahlmart and decided to stay there but not shop there too much, instead she decided to continue to shop at the small mom and pop stores as much as she could.  Trixxie parked at Wahlmart next the bright yellow tall golden arches.  She could smell the french fries and apple pies and grew hungry.  Trixxie glanced at the dashboard of her e-Cushman, the charge said 24V.  Originally, the Cushman was equipped with a 12 V battery but she replaced it with two 12 V batteries, Li+ ion.  They were slim batteries and charged up by the on-board solar panel and fuel cell.  And every time the Cushman braked, the two batteries would receive a charge (electrons would be added to the battery electrolyte by means of motor reversal, ie, electrical generation).  The electrons travel in the opposite direction of the charge and the current.  So, the battery terminal shows + and the current comes from there.  But actually, the electrons, the force here, come from the - terminal, the ground, the chassis often, and travel to the battery.<br><br>

Trixxie painted her e-Cushman a bright colour and she received many compliments on her work. But she used just ordinary paint and no clear coat sealer or wax so she tried to park beneath carports and awnings when possible or in garages because the weather wore down the paint.  She bought the Cushman when she newly arrived in Iowa on the Amtrak train.  Someone was selling it for cheap because it didn't work and was dented, needed a lot of repairs.  And Trixxie bought it on payments of $10 a week so it didn't cost her a lot.  She got the paint for free at the recycle place where people drop off paint and people can have it for free along with other haz mats like fertilizers, lacquers, chemicals, stains.  Trixxie was hungry by now so she went to sleep but was awakened a short time later by the sound of a meowing neko.  She opened her eyes, and there was a neko in her tent.  She had left open a tiny bit for air and a neko snuck in!  But it wasn't Whiskers, this neko was a different colour.  It was a nice orange colour with stripes.  Whiskers is a noir neko.<br><br>

The next morning, Trixxie woke up bright and early, awoken by all the hub-bub at Golden Arches.  It was a drive through restaurant, so lots of kids were driving through on their e-bikes picking up hash browns and pancakes for their teachers, tooting their horns to friends and playing their favorite country music.  In Iowa, people mostly listen to country music but they also like rock and a variety of other musique as well.  Violin is popular along with piano and organ.  Clarinet is also popular and flute.  Saxaphone, trumpet, brass and drums are less popular in Iowa except for marching bands.  The xylophone is very trendy in Iowa, and all the cool kids love to play xylophone at Vegetarian Club meetings after school when available.  The key is to keep the kids busy and out of the streets after school, let them have a safe place to do homework.  Trixxie's old apartment building was next to a school and she saw the after-school programmes and it warmed her heart to know the students were able to receive extra vegan snacks and play musical instruments instead of running the streets, reeking havoc all across town getting in fights or even worse, playing sports.  At that particular school, it was know to be a technology magnet school and so sports we de-emphasized.  Only frisbee and low-impact sports were offered at Maffberry Tech.  Rather than sports, the school offered many options like Debate Team, Math Team, Science Team, Chemistry Tournament, Travelling Robot Exhibition Teams and Software Dev Crypto Geeks.<br><br>

When Trixxie stopped by Yoshi's Cafe to show the frame to Yoshi's wife she passed close to a table full of script geeks, they were probably Iowa AI employees.  One of the gents was in a good mood and he recognized Trixxie as a Yoshi's employee and stuffed a tip in her hand before she could tell him no, she's not allowed to take tips.  She thanked him as he left the restaurant with his peers and then looked around for Sandra.  Sandra was out that day and it was just Yoshi and two new employees from South Dakota.  So, Trixxie decided to leave and continue her search for Whiskers because her shift wasn't set to begin for two more hours.  Trixxie left the cafe and walked up the alley through the clouds of flies.  She reached in her pocket to see how much the customer tipped her.  She say the tip, it wasn't money!  It was a crypto voucher.  It's some kind of QR code that she needs to scan and then it will deposit crypto in her virtual wallet.  But Trixxie didn't have a virtual wallet so she decided to stop in at the CoinBase office on Main Street.  In Maffberry, CoinBase has opened up a small corner office on the ground floor of Maffberry Bank building a couple of weeks ago, around the time that Iowa AI moved to town.  Trixxie had passed the CoinBase office many times and knew that the company dealt with crypto and virtual wallets so she decided that CoinBase would be the place to go.<br><br>

But when Trixxie arrived at CoinBase she saw no humans other than another customer using an ATM machine.  There was a row of 4 machines, that was all, no employees.  So, Trixxie went to one of the empty machines and used the AI features to explain her situation.  Five minutes later, she had a virtual wallet and some crypto!  The customer had been very generous, tipping $20 in crypto currency.  CoinBase offered free service to new customers so she was able to open up a virtual wallet and deposit the crypto cert with the QR code without paying the normal $15 fee.  Trixxie was happy as she left the CoinBase office and headed up Main Street.  She always wanted to own crypto, she just knew it was a great way to make money.  A terrific investment.  And now her dreams had finally come true!<br><br>

Chet Dowry is the pen name of Hajih Al-Faruk, the famous Punjabi from Pakistan who has already taken Allemagne by storm with his musical street performances and dance routines on the sidewalks and alleys of Dusseldorf.  Now, Chet has expanded his art to include the written form, novels.  Chet's first piece, a biography, was warmly welcomed by readers and thus, Chet is proud to present his second work, MYSTERY ON THE MENU.  Chet grew up in the Punjab to Sikh family with many sisters and brothers.  When he got married, he took his favourite younger sister with him to the new home with his bride to help cook and clean.<br><br>

Chet grew up eating meat and Fisch, lots of dairy, cheese.  However, Chet is now a dedicated vegetarian and very much in winemaking and gourmet vegetarian cooking.  Chet lives in Beverly Hills with his beautiful wife and four adoring children.  He frequently visits the Punjab where he puts on lavish vegan feasts for the townfolk and delights their hearts with his whirling dance routines and animated songs.  You can hear Chet sing on Punjabi Radio USA in the Bel Air area of Southern California along with Silicon Valley and Silicon Vineyard (Stockton/Lodi).  Chet enjoys playing frisbee and protesting against air pollution warehouses like Harbor Sign and Sex Club at 850 North Union St, 95205 where the company pollutes the air and dumps illegaly.<br><br>

Chet is against the holocaust in Gaza and stands firmly with the Phillistines (the Palestinians).  Chet has used his astrologie skills to predict that 2026 will be a tremendous Jahr of love and peace, his evidence is the sidereal position of Jove, Jove's Daddy and Poseidon.  Chet's wife is a bikini model and exercise instructor at local gym.  She enjoys vegan cooking and baking, loves making her own oatmeal granola.  Chet's oldest daughter joined the Hare Krishna movement but then she quit because she felt it was too controlling, so now she is writing a book about religion and decoding the bible which she says is fake and full of lies.  Chet's second-eldest daughter is captain of the cheerleading squad at her elite private school.  Chet Dowry has many book ideas, he says, and he tells us to stay tuned to Moonshee Publishing for his newest work and latest chapters of MYSTERY ON THE MENU.<br><br>

If you think your score was too low or too high, perhaps you need the help of Farmer Jim from SW Iowa.  He's the brother of Ronny, another great farmer from the Winterset area.  He might be able to help.<br><br>
If your score is less than 92, you may be able to improve your farming ideas or modeling.  It's common for farmers to want to buy more land and seeds, rent more land, buy equipment, buy trucks.  But that's all folly.  Plans that call for buying more than a few parcels and not using trees or perma-culture usually score low but not always.  Real estate investments not in growing areas may not score well. Contact Iowa AI for help!  We can get you going from good to best!  <a href="#register">Click here</a> to contact us &#x1F4F2 now.<br><br>If the goal is to make money, forget about farming, real estate, raising animals, that's no good for making money.  What you want to do is buy stocks instead, like AI and crypto stocks but you must buy the correct ones.  Then use the money you make from stocks to buy a nice hobby farm with a grove but no animals like pigs, only cats, inus, horses... because vegetarian is wave of future.<br><br>
Farmer Jim recommends that if people insist on hobby farming, the way to go is Solvang or Phelan, Yucca Valley.  Places where you can grow opuntia and ficus, salvia.  Those are key crops and can be made into medicinal Wein.  But, if stuck in Iowa, Farmer Jim recommends apples and other fruits and vegetables, no animals except maybe chickens for eggs.
