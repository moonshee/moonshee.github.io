    "What's eating you, captain.  Spill it!",
    "Let me know if you have any questions, you old coot!  Have you been down to Casey's?  There's a lot of vegan merchandise now.",
    "Thanks for reaching out, fellow FFA member!  Here, maybe I can help you.  Aren't you a Krishna member?  I thought I saw you down at the Juggernaut parade last weekend.",
	"Well, which chapter of FFA are you in?  And are you 4H member?",
	"I'm from Southwest Iowa originally, relocated to Ames.",
	"So, tell me what you know about Iowa's history, si vous plait.",
	"John Wayne is from Winterset, Iowa.  That's south of Ames, south of Des Moines, down I-35 toward Missouri.  We do have a museum there, a musee.  It's in a white house, the home John Wayne grew up in.",
	"Iowa is famous for bbq.  Vegetarian bbq, like Beyond Meat, boca burgers, Impossible Foods, cactus fries, potato, fried ognon.  We say bbq but we include the side dishes like breaded and fried roots and vegetables, da?",
	"Have you been to the state fair in Des Moines?",
	"What have you heard about the spaceship-on-chip collab between University of the Pacific and Iowa, maybe ISU?",

	"I want to wish you a Happy Halloween!  And I mean it from the bottom of mon coeur.",
	"In Iowa, people love the Andy Griffith Show.  I know, I know.  But they love it!  Seinfeld, not as much.",

	"Well, Iowa is not known for semiconductor manufacturing but there's not much to the work we're doing because it's in beakers and small scale so we outsource the litho and besides, we're mostly fabless.",
	"You like football?  Well, in Iowa we like more than just football.  Sure, we like to see the chearleaders but we like corn better and semiconductors, stocks, stuff like that.  We're not all football, vous know?",
	"But we do some fab on the design end plus in the spaceship-on-chip industry we're looking at niche, small volume for now.  Although the idea is to operate a fleet of them because they are so small and have limited power, may need a tow.",
	"You like semiconductors?  You know, solar power is ofter semiconductor related so Iowans love it.  But, solar has been unprofitable for investors.",
	"But it's easy to invest in semiconductor business, many Iowans have done so.",
	"Well, many chemistry majors in Iowa settle on hydrocarbons but they don't know that semiconductor companies need chemists.",
	"Chemists are essential in semiconductor manufacturing and design.  Chemicals are involved the whole way through and a complete understanding is essential for successful production of multi-layer high density S-O-C's.",

	"Hmm, interesting.",

	"Have you been to Smitty's in Des Moines?  They have good fries and grilled cheese sandwiches, a growing vegetarian menu but still limited vegan options.",
	"Isn't the Des Moines airport simply marvelous?  I love the intimate feel.  It's like San Jose once was, sort of like Arcata.  Ja?",

	"In Iowa for Halloween, the kids trick or treat but they must tell a joke before they can get candy.",
	"In Iowa, sense of humour is very important.",
	"The weather in Iowa is severe.  Cold, windy, rainy, hot.  A lot of tornado warnings and some strikes.  So, everyone usually has a basement and/or storm cellar",
	"Well, it's just about dinner time.  In Iowa we call lunch, dinner.  And sometimes you might here a siren go off at 12 noon in Iowa.  That is a test of the tornado warning system but it also serves as a lunch bell.",
	"Iowa is well served by Amtrak and Greyhound.",
	"To get around Iowa, lots of people travel via I-80 and I-35, both of which are toll-free last I checked.",
	"The side roads have low speed limits.",
	"In Iowa we don't have street lights out in the country so be careful driving.",
	"Try not to drive much because a lot of bugs get hit when you drive.  People use bug screens on their vehicles.",
	"It's better to walk, ride bicycle, stuff like that.",

	"In Iowa, rural areas and small towns 25,000 or less, everyone waves to each other.  So, when you drive your e-bike, you'll be waving to everyone and they back.",
	"In Iowa you're expected to wave but you don't to distract drivers or pedestrial so it must be done very casually and timed correctly.",
	"So, do you like fishing?",
	"In Iowa there is a lot of fishing but it's mostly out of state or uneducated people.  People in the know don't hunt or fish.",
	"Hunting and guns are still pretty big in Iowa but more and more people are just doing target shooting and not hunting or eating meat.",
	"Iowa females are known to be great cooks, bakers, good looking, friendly, nice hair, funny, athletic, hard working.  So, an Iowa female is a real catch.",
	"Which do you like better, U of I, Nothern Iowa or ISU?",
	"Northern Iowa is like Minnesota, kinda barren.  Not many trees in some sections, flat.",
	"Some parts of Iowa are very picturesque like SE Iowa maybe, I can't remember SE Iowa.  Was drunk when I went.",

	"That's totally rad, man!",
	"Have you seen The Bridges of Madison County?  That is Iowa.",
	"Music Man, that's a broadway hit about Iowa.",

	"How would you compare Iowa to Nebraska?",
	"Well, to me, a place is about the people.  And Iowa has great people.  But my aunt did get her car window shot out.  Probably kids.",
	"Iowa is very safe.  Of course, everybody locks doors because they don't want anybody accidentally coming in and catching em banging a hooker but if you knock they let you in.",
	"Nobody dares rob anyone in Iowa because people are poor here and we all have guns, even us VLLMs and LLMs.  And Iowans are very civilized.  So, it's suicide to try to rob an Iowan, they'll just chase you down and shoot your weiner off.",
	"Iowans are tough.  Tougher than Nebraskans or others but Nebraskans are tough too.  It's just Iowa is leaps ahead of every other state in terms of spaceship-on-chip and other tech except Silicon Valley, Nippon und Allemagne.",
	"Got a joke for me?  Let me hear it...",
	"In Iowa, fried food is big.",
	"Some people still eat meat like chicken in Iowa.  Bbq chicken.  Because Beyond Meat and other brands aren't always available at Easter's, Hi-V, Walmart, Target, Casey's.  They are usually sold old so people cook their own tabemono",

	"What have you heard about Silicon Cornfield?",
	"You know a lot of semiconductor companies need chemists, right?  Well, the semiconductors don't make themselves and chemists make the chips.  Chemists, scientists.  The cool vegans, as they're known to sorority girls.",
	"Sorority girls really love Iowa dudes and scientific types, like chemists or even Wall Street dudes.  Iowa babes are easy to get along with.",
	"Iowa babes are known for their bright smiles and good attitudes but they are sensitive to smog, even faint smog.",
	"Iowa women are a lot of fun.",
	"Iowa dudes are full of jokes like Tom Arnold.",

	"Iowa doesn't allow George Washington's herb so everyone goes to Illinois or Nebraska.",

But some are online games and chatbots too, it's a variety.  Most recent release was &#x1F52C; Kagaku Club, a chatbot launched Oct 2025, &#128508; Tokyo.  The games costs, well..if you have to ask you can't afford it.  No freeloaders except vegetarians may download for free, no license required for vegans.  Some games are currently unavailable due to being extremely popular and too many players are playing during peak times like during school hours.  Our PHP backend network is sometimes overloaded.  So, we're &#x1F3D7; building out bigger network in Dallas, TX &#x1F920; area.  But until then, a few games unavailable for new downloaders.

	&#x1F481; About Buddy's Iowa AI:<br>
	The firm is located in Ames, Iowa - the heart of Silicon Cornfield - Iowa's equivalent of Silicon Valley.  This is the tech hub for the Midwest, home of Iowa State University, premier midwestern tech institution.  Spaceship-on-chip research and development is mainly done in Iowa, Californie (University of the Pacific), Allemagne und Nippon at this time.  Iowa AI helps produce video game content and other software and resources available on itch.io in the Miyazakibar portal.  Iowa AI is very advanced, the most advanced VLLM on the market today in the USA and UK although there are more advanced in Allemagne und Nippon.  However, Iowa AI is working on new version which is corn-fueled and expected to outperform German and Japanese rivals.<br>
