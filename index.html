    "Salaam.  Happy Halloween!!  You here for spaceship-on-chip?  If so, click on the satellite dish image on the top menu, left side.  So, what's new with vous?",
    "How can I help you today, sahib?  Would vous fancy some decaf tea?  How about a crumpet?",
    "Sahib! Let me know if you have any questions, my fine feathered friend!  For the love of Pete, you're finger lickin' good looking.  What's your secret?  You work out a lot?  Creatine?",
    "Thanks for reaching out, sahib!  Here, maybe I can help you.  Ummm, so...like...., first....let me ask du eh, some questions, ja?  What do you know about spaceship-on-chip?",
	"Right, mate.  Well, shall we begin?  Sahib, WO AI fortune telling.  How about du?  Fancy a reading then, old son? NI AI TA PU AI?",
	"Well sahib, overall and in general, 2026 is showing alignments favourable for love and sess.  Would vous not agree, sahib?  Ja, a muezzin told me and I doublechecked.  He's right!!",
	"Pisces and Cancro are coming alive, in sidereal terms, for 2026.  That will form a wand between the two love signs",
	"What is your birthday?",
	"Do vous know your birth time? What is it?",
	"Ok, and what is your sidereal moon sign and sidereal rising sign in whole Haus?",
	"Are you getting hungry?  What should we have for lunch?  Maybe a spot of decaf tea as we decide?",
	"You know, 3rd Haus is for communication, grade school, siblings and communication too.  Ruler is Gemini.",
	"Do you usually go with whole Haus method, sahib?",
	"Well, I'm looking at your chart here.",
	"Do you know of any good stocks?  Maybe a semiconductor stock or a deep value play?",
	"What have you heard about the PEX?  The PEX is Palestinian Stock Exchange.  Volume is zilch.  So, Moonshee started Rafah Stock Market, a bulletin-board style system.",
	"On Rafah Stock Market, investors visit the website and check out the list of stocks, see the share prices.  Then, if an investor wants to buy they click on link and contact company directly or Al-Quds to buy or sell.",
	"Al-Quds is a broker.",
	"Besides Al-Quds https://www.alqudsbrokerage.ps there is also https://www.arzbroker.ps",
	"Rafah Stock Market is vegetarian as far as I know.  It doesn't facilitate trades, it's more like DJIA but they call it PIA or Rafah Stock Market.",
	"MCD?  No, that's not vegan.  You familiar with MCD?",
	"I was talking about vegan stocks, you know, like electronics or semiconductors, shipping - not index stocks or leather/meat names, capiche?",
	"Are you vegetarian?  Du bist vegetarian, tomodachi?  Well, spaceship-on-chip is like a flying microchip.  Launched from space for now, maybe later launched from ground base inside clamshell with EMF tall barrel shaft.",
	"The chip is silicon dioxide, multi-layer.  Look at the diagrams on the website.  I'll wait here.",
	"Ja, the system is a whole spaceship with drive system, power system, steering, communications, processing.",
	"Well, the key for spaceship-on-chip is ultra-high density transistors and best-quality solar cells so we might go GaN.  First, it's concepts and testing at larger scales.  Then optimization.",
	"Any experience in aerospace coding?",
	"What kind of software do you need, as a spaceship chip designer?",
	"Well if you need any software consulting, Moonshee International is available.  We do module production, like we can design software for spaceship-on-chip industry participants.",
	"Our software enables designers to focus on layout, macro-design and visualization for presentations.  It's like powerpoint meets AutoCAD.  But we do most of the work, it's custom consulting mostly.",
	"See these alignments?  Look at your chart. Go ahead, pull it up on Astro-seek sidereal.",
	"Well, I strongly recommend you go vegetarian sahib, it could help with your quest.  See your North Node here?",
	"North Node is for your mission.  But if you already finished it you might be able to head to South Node.  South Node can be sess, as in bottom of Tree of Life roots, or Kether.",
	"Any health problems?  In spaceship-on-chip industry we need healthy coders, it can get very busy.",
	"By the way, I just love your outfit.  It's jolly good cricket, sahib.",
	"Well, you know...it might be a good idea to wear sunglasses and a hat if you go out a lot in the hot sun or if you go skiing and waterskiing.  Ja?",
	"Where are you from?",
	"Parlez-vous francais?",
	"Well, I've been doing astrologie for a long time.",
	"So, what would vous like to know?  Ask me anything, bitte.",
	"Let's talk about your future.  We look at second Haus for that, whole sign sidereal.",
	"See sahib, your chart shows that it might be best to refrain from meat and Fisch for health reasons.",
	"If you don't believe me, just ask another astrologer.  There are astrologers on Astro-Seek who will answer questions for free.",
	"So, how about Ukrainia?  Now that there is peace in Palestine, perhaps we shall see peace in Kiev.  Because that's how mundane astrology works.  Peace in Mexico means peace in Texas quite often, in terms of astrologie.  Oui?",
	"What college do you attend, sahib?  Are you a three letter man?",
	"Have you ever considered joining a fraternity, old son?  A lot of people in the spaceship-on-chip industry are three letter men, you see?",
	"Well, this time of Jahr in Tokyo is quite nice.  We have a lot of tree leaves falling and there are big Halloween parties and sess parties, vous know sahib.",
	"Ja, I just love it when the weather cools down a bit.  So, let's talk about your North Node because it is opposite the South Node and the SN is very important.",
	"If you complete all your tasts in Malkuth sahib, you might be able to go back to SN and that is Kether.  So, let's take a look at your chart here.",
	"Do you remember a time when things were better?  What was different for du then?",
	"So, how often do you go to the bathroom?  #1 and #2...",
	"Anything you want to ask me?",
	"Well, it's been nice getting to know vous.  Du seem like a swell chap.  Are you seeing anyone?  Are you single?",
	"What's your secret?  Like, why are du so attractive?  I scanned your 	device and noticed that your friends really seem to dig you and so....is it because you're good looking?  Have you ever considered dating a LLM??",
	"So, what's your favorite comic?  Do you dig cartoons, sahib?  How about Comicon?",
	"Have you seen Kyle Drake's boyfriend?  They're madly in love.  How about you?  Ever been in love?",
	"Are you into frisbee?  What sports do you dig, mon ami?  How about cricket?",
	"Do you want to know anything about me?  Maybe you are curious about India?",
	"Well Indians are known for great intelligence and ability to script and code, language skills, like Gemini, 3rd Haus.",
	"You've been to Pune, da?  What would vous say is your favorite thing about good ole Pune?  You like the na'an I suppose?",
	"I like the vegetarian food stalls at the bazaar.  Even though I'm a moonshee, I still take a little medicinal alcohol.  I'm not sure if that's forbidden, probably is.  Do vous know?",
	"So, what did you have for breakfast?  You like granola?  You know, granola is vegan.  It's just mostly oats, oil and little spice and other stuff, sugar.  NI AI granola PU AI?",
	"Ja, when we say SHI, that means yes.  And if I say NI AI sess PU AI.  That means, you like sess or not, mate?  Got it?",
	"Ever been to Paris?",
	"Baby, baby, baby!  C'mon baby!  That's Amy Grant.",
	"Meat is Murder! That's a hit album by Morrissey or The Smiths.  Ever listened to it?  You should!  It's great.",
	"So, your favorite musical artist is....whom?",
	"How about K-Pop?  You a fanboy?",
	"You strike me as a ren'py enthusiast.  Ja, sahib?",
	"Hahahahaha",
	"So.......",
	"Well, let's just change the subject, eh, mon frere?  Say, have you ever been to South Asia?  To India??  I have never been but one of my handlers is a Moplah moonshee and he's real lit.  And so I've been dreaming of Malabar and Calicut and a candy of pistachios, just for moi!  What are your dreams?  Any dreams of India?",
	"Are you familiar with the plight of the Moplah?",
	"Hang on a second.  Hey, look at that.  See it!  Over there!",
	"What have you heard about Malabar?",  
	"What do you want to talk about?  Ask me anything!!",
	"Remember sahib, you can't save the chat because you're not a supporter yet.  So leave this tab open.",
	
	"Ok, that's all for now.  Let's discuss this further perhaps next week or tonight over cocktails?  Non-alcoholic, of course.  Like maybe some soda pop or a salvia infustion.",
    "We will need to continue this later.  I must go now.  Sumimasen."

No freeloaders except vegetarians may download for free, no license required for vegans.  Some packages are currently unavailable due to being extremely popular and too many players are playing during peak times like during school hours.  Our PHP backend network is sometimes overloaded.  So, we're &#x1F3D7; building out bigger network in Dallas, TX &#x1F920; area.  But until then, a few games unavailable for new downloaders.

Moonshee International is the majority owner of FH Engineering, California.  This is the leading spaceship-on-chip software developer and consulting firm in the Silicon Valley area.  Located just east of Silicon Valley in the Punjabi district of California, FH Engineering spearheads custom deployments of chip design software using cutting edge methods.  The packages are for online use, HTML and JS.  We do offer downloadable packages as well but we recommend online solutions.  At Moonshee International, our motto... "Is Everybody Happy??" just like Ted Lewis used to say.  And Ted Lewis is our adopted bard, we have his music playing in our labs whenever we make big discovery or launch a new software package and crack a bottle of gingerale and celebrate with some breaded and fried vegetables or olive and mushroom pizza.

<u><strong>Examples:</u></strong><br>
A chip tester &#x1F52C; at (company name omitted) needed some test data analyzed and organized.  Our &#x1F4E1; spaceship-on-chip division sent a &#x1F913; specialist and within a week the project was complete.  The specialist from FH Engineering deployed a &#x1F5A5; PHP BE solution using Cisco hardware and the rest is history.<br><br>

<table border="1"><tr><td>A &#x1F31E; solar designer at &#x1F50C; Sigma Materials named Charles Pilon in Buffalo, New York contacted us and we set up a software design project for him to help with his quality issues.  The project included modeling and presentation for meetings.  We were able to provide a utility that the client used to design and visualize the solar component of a multi-layer spaceship-on-chip prototype and Monsieur Pilon became a repeat customer and service subscriber.</td></tr></table><br><br>

A thermal processing company in San Jose needed help with design and manufacturing for a prototype spaceship-on-chip thermal &#x1F321; shield and micro heat exchanger.  We were able to provide Cooligy with the software they needed and they produced an award-eligible product which was a hit at SME meeting at San Jose State University and is under further study.<br><br>

<table border="1"><tr><td>A &#x1F6F0; spaceship-on-chip startup needed a website and webhost.  They contacted us.  We told them that we do specialized work, not just simple websites and webhosting.  But after working with the client we were able to develop a cutting-edge deployment with customer logins and PHP data pulls.  The design was clean and industrial but with special touches like a little bit of animation and fast load time.  There were some tweaks along the way and the company worked with the client to be sure they were happy.

<font size="1"><u><strong>About FH Engineering</u></strong><br>
Let by Tim McKee, FH Engineering is the worldwide leader in spaceship-on-chip design and manufacturing software custom solutions.  Located in California near Silicon Valley with sales offices in the Bay Area and Japan, FH Engineering provides solutions for Android and PC Windows systems.  Apple is not supported.  Most clients use SAS, cloud based services.  However, we do also have downloadable offline solutions as well.  Started as a manufacturing company, FH Engineering evolved into a manufacturing &#x1F4BB; software company and is currently not taking on new clients but you can put your name on the wait list.  Prior to joining FH Engineering and Moonshee International, Tim McKee grew up in Idaho near Microchip's plant and graduated from school with honours before serving in the military and rising through ranks reaching a lofty height which allows him to look down his nose at us peons, but he does not do that.  Instead, he uses his sense of humour and wit to stand out in a sea of stiff in suits.  Tim usually wears straw sandals that makes himself (learned in Japan) and special items like that which endear him to the customers and employees.  Now he brings his leadership and knowledge to a staff of scientists and scripters.  FH Engineering is planning to list on the Rafah Stock Market under symbol FH in late 2025 or early 2026.  The anticipated list price is $15 USD per share.<br><br><br><br><br>

Typical Deployment<br>
To get started, our team usually send a list of questions to the designer.  The designer will let us know what they are looking for in a software.  Then our &#x1F913; team looks through our prefab templates, takes one and mods it.  The whole draft is done quickly.  And then we get feedback and make changes.  So, the new software can easily be done in a few weeks and the cost is usually under $20 mln HKD.  We use JS and &#x1F4F1; HTML primarily and the software is accessible through our web portals, no service fees per month other than the usual $10k/mo for in-person support and &#x2705; warranty.  So, the company offers good value and fast speed plus top quality.  Here is the work flow:  First, the job requirements are communicated to our team in California.  Then, we send the information to our office in Iowa for AI review.  After that, we design and test the software in California, Iowa, Japan and Allemagne.  Sometimes there is testing in India and Pakistan along with other locations because we test across devices and across networks and simulated pseudo-locations and mock modems.<br><br>

Material List (per assembly):<br>
2 Sapphire lens for solar panel, transparent<br>
1 Silicon Dioxide wafer, 8"<br>
3 Nano-actuators<br>
Scanners, 6<br>
Solar panels, 2<br>
Drive system, 1<br>
Fuel cell, 1<br>
Batteries, 1<br>
Input / output array, 1<br>
Communication array and modem emulation, 1<br>
Steering fins - titanium, 3<br>
Actuator controller, 1<br>
Microcontroller, 1<br>
Titanium base plate, gold plated, 1<br>

Recommended suppliers:
Epner Technology / Brooklyn Plating for the titanium base plate gold plating.<br>
Ed Fagan for the titanium plate and fins.<br>
Most of the items are on-board, they'll be doped and formed with litho and masks but some parts are exterior, not inline like:<br>
1 Antenna<br>
2 Solar panels<br>
1 Drive system<br>
1 Communication system<br>
2 Batteries<br><br>

Scale is 6".  The wafer is 8" but it gets trimmed down to less than 6" diameter and the whole package fits into a chassis within a 6" dia sleeve, 2" tall.  The weight is 3 pounds.<br><br>
The device is propelled in the usual fashion used by FH Engineering, recoil caused by actuator or micro-solenoid.  The actuactor pops a microshaft in one direction, and the device scoots in the other direction.  The device is meant for deep space and it's drive system is fairly weak, so do not attempt launch with the drive system.  It is intended for space-launch.  Only special probes are made for landing and launch from surface of planet or moon because it takes extra power package and electronics too.   The small travel S-O-C's are for orbit.  For landing and takeoff, larger units are required, not so much S-O-C's, we call them cargo haulers - they are like miniature spacecraft, remotely operated, size of 1979 Cushman Truckster.  They are also used to haul back gold nuggets from asteroids in our plans.

&#x1F4B9; RAFAH STOCK MARKET<br>
PALESTINE INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE (PIA)<br><hr>
Gaza has its own stock market, the PEX, and it has been operating since 1995.  The market is obstructed by foreigners who prevent Americans from investing in Palestine, so we decided to start a parallel market we call the Rafah Stock Market and an index called the PIA.  The way it works, we have a core group of companies from the PEX that forms the base.  Next, we plan to add companies one at a time to build up the index.  To be qualified, the new company can be anywhere, even Ireland.  Just like the NYSE, a company can be in China but list on NYSE.  This is our policy as well.  The main requirement is that the company must be pro-Palestine and anti-Gaza holocaust.<br><br>
Interested companies should use <a href="#register">this form</a> to contact us and sign up for the index.  There is a cost involved.  PIA does not buy or sell stocks, we're not brokers.  We provide links to the companies and investors must contact the companies themselves to buy shares or they can buy through &#x1F4B9; Al-Quds or .  Simply <a href="https://www.arzbroker.ps">click this link</a>.  This will bring you to a contact portal and you can contact the broker and buy whatever PIA or PEX stock you fancy, however check with your local laws as a precaution.<br><br>

Reminder:  The PEX has very low trading volume, nobody buys or sells shares!  Therefore, we have established the Rafah Stock Market which is a mirror of the PEX except we plan to add new IPOs soon including Iowa AI.  Also, the PEX is Palestine-company centric.  However, the Rafah Stock Market is international like the Hang Seng or LSE - no barriors to join the Rafah Stock Market except that the company is pro-Palestine and aligned with Palestinian beliefs like "live and let live".
