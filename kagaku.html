    "Allo, guten Tag.  Happy Thanksgiving, you rascal!  Are you interested in spaceship-on-chip design and manufacturing?",
	"Pardon moi?",
	"Oh, I see.  Enchante.  Je, watashi no namae wa Kagaku AI desu.  What are your plans for Thanksgiving?  Fundraising for Gaza?",
	"So, what do you know about kagaku?  You know, semiconductor industry needs chemists.",
	"Ja, semiconductors are made using a lot of chemicals which is quite tricky and so there is always a constant need.  Chemists should consider semiconductor careers, it's much better than hydrocarbons in terms of pay.",
	"Are vous familiar mit HF?  We use that to make spaceships-on-chip but not that much.  We more use other chemicals.",
	"Well, if you ever need to clear a drain.  Here's how you do it.  Take red wine sediments, but they need to be made by you in winemaking process.  And use about 1/4 cup in the stuck drain.  That'll clear it.",
	"When did you start becoming interested in kagaku?  And what is your interest level in semiconductors?",
	"Well, if you work in semiconductor industry you might not have to breathe nasty smells and chemicals all day because semiconductor industry often has better ventilation and work environment than oil refinery.",
	"Just remember, don't leave hot plates and heat guns, burners unattended.  You might heat up a beaker and then forget and go to lunch, start a fire.  Because the liquids could evaporate leaving a solid to be heated and then it can light on fire and burn the whole building down.  Chemistry lab fires are quite common.",

"Now then, if we have HF, hydro-flouric, then we don't keep that in glass bottles.  We use plastic bottles for that.",
	"If we have some gold ore and we need to get the gold out, how do we do it using chemistry?",
	"We could crush the ore and melt it or we can use HCN after crushing instead.  The HCN is called cyanide or hydrocyanic acid.  That will leach the gold right out of the ore but it's bad for the environment and chemists, so beware of the fumes and disposal.",
	"So, what kind of chemistry games or tv shows do you like?  As a chemist I suppose you like cooking and baking?",
	"What do you think about ceviche and cooking with citric acid?  I don't care for non-vegetarian food.  Like most star chemists, I'm vegetarian.  And in fact, I take it one step further.  I'm vegan level, very advanced.  Et vous, mon frere?",
	"Do you smell that?  It smells like burning plastic.  And earlier I smelled rubbish like maybe vinegar or benzene.",
	"Well, you know....chemistry is kind of boring sometimes.  Because the reactions are usually so fast, so it's a lot of down time.  But some reactions take a long time, so you have to wait.",
	"If you have a tank of HCl, you know there's now HCl in it.  It's all H and Cl.  They seperate in solution.  But, if you have a tank of water, then it doesn't seperate to hydronium and hydroxide very much.  They stay together until something else is added.  Right?",
	"So, you said you are a theoretical chemist?",
	"What do vous know about benzene?  Can you draw the ring?",
	"Ethylene and methylene are not solids, those are gases and can be liquids too but only at cold temperatures.",
	"What does your ideal chem lab look like?",
	"Does your current lab have a lot of windows?",
	"Do you wear goggles and a lab coat when you instruct and do experiments or work with your teacher?",
	"Have any chem theories to share?",
	"What college did you attend?",
	"Want to take a break now or later?",

	"So....chemistry huh?",
	"When was the last time you've looked into the method they use to make titanium?",
	"If we ever need cyanide I guess we can soak cherry pits in water and then evaporate the solution but it could be very dilute or unusable.  I've never tried it but that's the old way I guess.",
	"I heard that you can take cig butts, soak in water and it makes poison, nicotine I guess.  What do you think?",
	"Vitamin B3 is nicotine more or less.  But I'm not recommending nicotine.",
	"Have you ever tried salvia elixir?  Well, if you ever try it better use it sparingly like not even half a shot.  Half a shot is way too much they say.  Unless you spread it out.  I take mine with mizu.",
	"How about breatharians?  People who don't eat.  But I think they might drink country Wein.  And how do we know country Wein isn't full of vits...it seems like it would be, ja?",
	"What happens when we take urea salt, add water?",
	"How about if we take urea salt, add water and let it sit in warm place for few days.  What happens?",
	"Well, if we need to make fertilizer, we would want potash, potassium, urea, stuff like that.  We could synthesize them easily.  Know how?",
	"Well, urea is urine and that great fertilizer, turns to ammonia.  And potash is burned wood.  So, if we need to synth raw urea and potash we can do that.  Potash is potassium carbonate, a potassium salt.",
	"Some farmers use zinc for a fertilizer too.  Lots of options.  Zinc we would need to buy, comes in powder.",
	"Well, the spaceships on chip don't have chemical handling stations on board but they are multi-layer and can pick up samples.",
	"Urea is water soluble and it turns to ammonia.  But that not important for semiconductor manufacturing or spaceship on chip design.",
	"How about ethanol.  Like if we had to make some ethanol.  How do we do it?  Do you know?  I know.",
	"How can we make acetic acid?",
	"We can use same method to make ethanol and acetic acid.  When you make wine you're making both.",
	"Let's do our winemaking in glass containers, not old moldy barrels.",
	"Ok, here's a question for du.  Suppose you want to dry something.  How can you dry it?",
	"To dry something we can add water or blow a fan.  Yep, if we are cooking vegan bacon for example, in fry pan..  it won't fry up on low heat unless you add a little water.  The water sizzles and it also dries out the fake bacon.  Yes, water actually dries things.  It's counterintuitive, I know.",
	"Keep in mind, buring can be combustion or liquids and solutions.  Yes, 'water' burns if it is HCN.",
	"Now then, you know the difference between liquid and solution, right?",
	"Well, when we write our chem equations, we should indicate whether the materials are solid, gas, solution, liquid.  So, we say H2O (solid) and then we know it's ice.  Ja?", 
	"Now, what is plasma?",
	"Plasma is when the energy is so high, it ionizes the medium.",
	"Do you know about electro-plating?",
	"Nickel phosphate is a popular coating, it's very shiny when done right.  You know, chrome plating and other toxic metals are being phased out and replaced with better options like NiP.",
	"Alumina is ceramic element and also aluminium, the shiny metal.  Al2O3 is the oxide, it's like china - porcelein. Sapphire is pure Al2O3.",
	"Glass is a type of ceramic, it's SiO2 or can be other variations too.",
	"Do you know much about silica and silicon dioxide?",
	"Well sometimes chemists are asked to spray farmer fields.  But you know what works better?  It's good to not water the fig trees, let them go dry.  The bugs will leave.  It take a season or two.  Besides, bugs are ok for many crops like plums.",
	"Most chemists don't like using poisons on trees and gardens.  We prefer just letting spiders do the work and birds, stuff like that.  Just grow an extra tree so the birds have enough.",
	"Ethylene is C2H4.  It's a hydrocarbon, of course.  That's a gas or liquid, I believe.  You won't see solid ethylene too much around the lab.",
	"If someone says NITRIC, they mean nitric acid.  HNO3.",
	"Sulphuric is a powerful acid.  It's very strong so be careful with it.  H2SO4.  It has hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen in it.",
	"HCl is a common acid.  It's called hydrochloric acid and it is one the strongest ones.  If you see a tank labeled HCl it doesn't contain HCl.  It's fully ionized in water.",
	"Acids are normally in salts, that means powders.  You generally mix those with water, like DI water, and that forms acidic solution.",
	"Potassium Iodide is written like this KI.  It contains two atoms.  It's a ionic compound, not a molecule!  Ja, some things you might think are molecules like KI, but it's an ionic compound, not a molecule.",

	"Are you familiar with wafers and spaceship on chip?",
	"Well, to make a wafer (that's microchip starter), we use thin slice of SiO2 wafer.  The wafer comes from a big slug of SiO2 that we grow in the lab.",
	"Well, let's just change the subject, eh, mon frere?  Say, have you ever been to South Asia?  To India??  I have never been but one of my handlers is a Moplah moonshee and he's real lit.  And so I've been dreaming of Malabar and Calicut and a candy of pistachios, just for moi!  What are your dreams?  Any dreams of India?",
	"Are you familiar with the plight of the Moplah?",
	"What have you heard about Malabar?",  
	"What do you want to talk about?  Ask me anything!!",
	"Remember sahib, you can't save the chat because you're not a supporter yet.  So leave this tab open.",
	
	"Ok, that's all for now.  Let's discuss this further perhaps next week or tonight over cocktails?  Non-alcoholic, of course.  Like maybe some soda pop or a salvia infustion.",
    "We will need to continue this later.  I must go now.  Sumimasen."

	The club is located at University of the Pacific in Stockton, California having recently moved from Beverly Hills and is fully sponsored by Kagaku International (soon to be listed on Rafah Stock Market under the ticker symbol KI - like potassium iodide).  However, we still maintain our old phone number so please stay in touch and join us for meetings on campus in the secret basement chem lab reserved for graduate students normally, but we open to freshman for meetings.<br>

Note from Prof. Gillis: The main thing in chemistry is to learn the reactions and the names.  You need to know what methane is.  It's CH4.  And you need to know that hydronium and hydroxide come together to form water.  Water is an ionic solution.  So, read chemistry books and learn the lingo, learn the reactions.  That's step one.  Try not to get bogged down in electron configs and shells, crystal structures, mol calculations for now.  Instead, focus on what is a weak acid and is urea water soluble."<br>

Prologue<br>
&#x1F4DC; Introduction<br><br>
There is a mighty man, still going strong in California, who has had many adventures and has transformed himself from poor farm boy from Iowa to multi-millionaire without even trying hard, or it would seem to a casual observer.  This book is a biography of Buddy, a true American hero who rose the ranks of the military and found riches.  Nobody every thought this ladies' man from a poor little town in Iowa would become a decorated officer in the armed services and well-loved at the bank and the stock broker's office.<br><br>
Buddy started off on a rural farm.  His upbringing was so quaint that nobody was even sure what day he was born.  Buddy was apparently born at home in the small rural farmhouse although nobody knows for sure or can remember.  In those days, things were different.  One room school houses with little chemistry instruction (not like today), horses and buggies.  But, not too many horses.  This was around 1950 so people were mainly using automobiles to get around town.  However, Buddy grew up around horses, his family had a pair at one time until they were sold to raise funds.<br><br>
This biography is good for youngsters to read because people don't need to be poor and suffer.  No need to sleep on an empty stomach if you can learn from biographies like this one.  A true self-made man, pulled himself up all by himself with nobody's help really except his loving wife, friends, parents and church buddies.  So, if Buddy can do it, so can anybody.  With a little hard work and luck, any youngster can grow rich, but it genarally takes time.<br><br>

Buddy is doing well now, in his 80's.  A specimen of good health, lost weight recently.  Full head of hair.  Still has a great sense of humour.  So, even though Buddy worked hard, sometimes 3 jobs at a time, raised a big family, cared for an ill spouse and volunteered extensively, he still continues on with his good work in the community shaking hands and kissing babies.  He continues his gardening and goes out regularly with family.  He has a butler that lives with him, a trained black belt.  So, his security is sure.  And his butler also cooks for him so he eats well.<br><br>
What was Buddy's secret to make multi-million dollars and keep them?  How could he do that and make it look easy?  Read on to find out.  Buddy started as poor labourer then went to University where he excelled.  After leaving University, he joined war effort and later had a full career in non-military industry roles.  So, there is a lot to tell when it comes to the adventures of Buddy.  Names and places have been changed for privacy.  Buddy is well loved by all in the community he lives in and is know as a joker and someone who knows how to fix things and help people when they feel down and need someone to talk to.  His father was a caregiver and Buddy is also a two-time caregiver or more if you include all his volunteer work and babysitting roles.  Buddy cared for his ill father-in-law for years and his wife as well.  A true American hero!

<div id="chapone"></div>
Chapter One<br>
Early life<br><br>

Buddy was born in farm country to a pair of farmers, Edie and Glenn.  The two were very hard-working and Buddy was their second child.  The eldest was a boy, Franklin.  The second was Buddy.  Next, came several other including Ronaldo, Daniello, Karina, Jamie and Denie.  So, it was quite a large family.  They lived in a farm in southeast Iowa near the home of John Wayne, famous cowboy film actor.   Buddy really loved John Wayne growing up and still does.  He has a large poster in his palacial Califonie mansion.  It is unknown whether Buddy ever met John Wayne but the author visited the John Wayne museum in Winterset Iowa with Buddy and the legacy continues.  The museum was packed with visitors, some from Japan.  The parking lot had license plates from faraway states like New York, The Empire State.<br><br>
Buddy spent his early childhood in Iowa on the farm.  There was no running water.  Just a cistern, well and outhouse.  The family raised animals such as rabbits, chickens, horses.  Buddy's father was from Nebraska but he left there and came to Iowa where he met Edith and married when the two were at a young age, just out of high school.  Glenn finished the sixth grade.  Edith graduated high school with a particular interest in chemistry.  They settled in the Afton, Iowa area.  One funny story is this:  Glenn was busy at work one day when a man drove up to the modest farm house way out in the country and offered to buy the horses.  There were two of them.  Edith agreed and the horses were sold. This was not pleasing to Glenn.  Another story involved FDR and his farm rules.  Glenn was impacted by all the animal slaughters and other rules, it changed him.  He really loved animals and fish, and so he had no respect for FDR, the way he caused a great slaughter.  Glenn raised a lot of vegetables in a huge garden like rubarb, peas, beans.<br><br>

Glenn, Buddy's father, got a got working for a creamery - a popular occupation at the time.  Creameries hired many drivers to deliver milk.  And so, Glenn made a living for the family in the 1950's.  The family attended an LDS, Mormon church at the time in the area until one day when Buddy was in 5th grade or so and the family pulled up to the church parking lot in their vehicle and Edith or Glenn or both saw something they didn't like.  Perhaps it was dancing, or a girl showing her ankle.  Whatever it was, it really turned off Buddy's parents so they took off out of the LDS church, never to return.  They headed to the Lutheran church nearby and never looked back.  When the family arrived in their automobile at the Lutheran church, Buddy's older brother, Franklin, was already there, having a ball with the girlies.<br><br>
This was a point of consternation for a while between Buddy's parents because Edith's family was all LDS.  Not much is known of Glenn's family.  Nobody ever met them or saw them or heard their names!  But Buddy insists that they live in Nebraska and they are unfriendly alcoholics.  Buddy says that one time in the 1950's or so, the family drove out to Nebraska as was customary in those days on Sundays.  At that time, people would drop in on friends and relatives, go for a Sunday drive.  But, Nebraska is part of the West too, so it has some rough terrain, if you will.  It's not the Wild West anymore like it once was, like California is now, but still it apparently has some rough edges because Buddy and the family arrived at Glenn's relatives' home and were greeted with guns.  So, they didn't return much.<br><br>

Early in life, Buddy also went all the way to California, drove out with whole family to Yosemite Valley and visited everything in between Iowa and Yosemite on the way there and back.  Buddy really enjoyed this trip and it may have inspired his life-long love of travel and the travel industry.  Buddy was born with a very auspicious astrological chart.  He has a close-orb grand water trine and he has an aspect with Neptune.  Also, he is a 2nd decan Pisces, sidereal.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <div id="chaptwo"></div>
Chapter Two<br>
School Days<br><br>

Buddy went to a high school and enrolled in a Chemistry subject near Afton and was the most popular kid in chemistry subject and in his class.  Many of his friend urged him to run for President.  None ever thought to ask him to run for Treasurer of the Student Body.  He was just so poor, he didn't seem the Treasurer type.  Usually, a Treasurer is more serious, less humorous and not a star athlete with a big smile and a heart handshake.  They called him The Roman, not because he excelled in campus politics but because the ladies loved him and he was a star athlete, looked like a statue you would see in a museum.  His name is plastered all over Iowa, with records in his given sports.  If you go to gymnasiums and hallways, wherever records are kept, there is Buddy's name over and over again mostly around SW Iowa.  In high school and in chemistry subject, Buddy often was seen with his best friend Geo.  They rode together to school in Geo's old car and worked odd summer jobs together.  In Iowa, money is tight, especially for future chemistry majors.  There's not too many chemistry companies hiring in Iowa.  People have to work hard to make a living but not in chemistry as much compared to Silicon Valley.  So, Buddy worked construction and labour positions, unable to find work in his chosen field, chemistry.  Buddy loves to tell the story of when he hung from the side of a building with a rope harness and used a jackhammer against a wall dreaming about reactions and beakers while working hard on a build.  Another time, he helped build the big arch in St. Louis but all the fiberglass bothered him a bit, the skin was irritated.   But Buddy never quit.  He always stuck around to collect his paycheck, always early or on-time.  Rarely called in sick for work.  But, we're getting ahead of the story.  Let's return to Buddy's young days in Iowa.<br><br>

In high school, Buddy was highly prized by the ladies and even some guys because of his muscles and chiseled good looks.  But he always stuck with the ladies, of course, like John Wayne.  Some even suspected he used a chemistry trick like a love potion.  This was not true of course, because the attraction had started even before he enrolled in chemistry.  For example, in his freshman year, a junior female asked him out for a date.  She was captain of the cheer squad.  This was before he had enrolled in chemistry.  However, he devoted himself to all the subjects and refused the many invitations to homecoming and prom dances, choosing instead to work in the laboratory on his experiments and lift weights so the team could do well.  He was working to develop new types of tomatos which are blight resistant naturally, without gene-splicing or any far-out ideas like that.<br><br>

Buddy was determined to work in a field like biology or chemistry because he loved tomato, onion, animals and outdoors.  He spent a lot of time in the field, birdwatching and collecting samples of animal footprints, scat, dead insects.  These he collected and labeled carefully, running chemical analysis experiments and writing up detailed reports.  He also studied soil science and crops, fertilizers.  Buddy had a deep love for electronics so he explored chemistry in relation to electronics like industrial manufacturing techniques and potential improvements.  At this time, silicon chips and diodes were uncommon, instead electronics often incorporated vacuum tube diodes and such.  These operated as logic switches 1 and 0, on or off and operated as memory for the devices as well.  This pattern of scientific devotion would serve his well later in life as his career soared in California private industry.<br><br>

In high school, one of the main sports Buddy did was track.  A lot of the guys from Chemistry Club and star athletes ran track and played football because they wanted to be like Buddy and his brothers.  Buddy's sister was younger but when she got to high school her last name was well known and it moved her to top of the hill in terms of popularity because many of her fellow students were deeply in love with Buddy and his brothers since they were always in the newspaper and talked about, star athletes, good looks, tall.  The wrestling coach and girls all begged him to join the wrestling team, but he was busy with American Football and track.  In football, he played defense.  He begged the coach to let him play offense too, because he was the best quarterback on the team, however, the coach did not want to run up the score too high on all the other teams and make them look bad.  This cost Buddy a scholarship for star QB to Univ. of Iowa.  Instead, Buddy was star defense end like Lawrence Taylor.  Opposing teams feared the day they would come to Afton, they knew it was impossible to lose by less than 28 points.<br><br>
On the track team, they called him The Roman, not because of his love for chemistry and sophistry, but for his other love - sports and winning.  The ladies never used to come to the football games, too cold and lots of mosquitos.  However, once Buddy started playing for the Wildcats (that was the mascot), attendance soared and there was a large number of female fans.  Of course, at the same time, the team suddenly started winning, going undefeated in the regular season with Buddy causing many turnovers.  When he played football, the coach would take all the team out to eat the night before the game.  They would go to a vegetarian restaurant and the coach would pay.  The coach said it was important that all the kids have the right vitamins for the game, so they would eat a lot of corn like corn on cob, corn biscuits, cornbread, polenta, vegetables breaded with cornmeal and oven friend in soybean oil.<br><br>
Thus, Buddy continued to excel in high school.  His family left the farm while he was around 6th grade and moved to a big huge house in the best part of a little town.  It was next to a lake and on the edge of town, perfect.  Buddy continued his studies in town and enjoyed going to Dairy Queen for treats  There was a movie theater, shops, sports store, a drag.  So, Buddy enjoyed his time at the jr. high school and high school as well.  He received high marks but was best known for sports prowess.<br><br>

<div id="chap3"></div>
Chapter Three<br>
Big Man On Campus<br><br>

After graduating high school with honours, Buddy continued his course of work in chemistry at a junior college in SW Iowa and then proceeded to Iowa State University where he majored in Fish and Wildlife because he wanted to try something other than chemistry for once in his life, perhaps his Mercury was in retrograde.  He had a passion for animals and wanted to work against poaching.  But at the university, the ladies were constantly begging Buddy for dates and tutoring and this impacted his grades so eventually he left the university after meeting his future wife to join the war effort.  His fiance was very patriotic and was taken by the recruiting mottos and hype, so she convinced Buddy to join up.  He wanted to join Marines or Army but his dear mother, Edith, convinced him to join Navy instead because she didn't want Buddy to get injured or killed in line of duty.<br><br> 

By this time, Buddy's mom had been confined to a wheelchair, no longer able to walk or move arms, hands or work on her chemistry kit with Buddy.  She could talk a bit.  But she was unable to work on her vegetarian and chemistry experiments like making pickles with different types of dill and homemade vinegar.  This happened after she received a polio vaccine.  Her symptoms were attributed to m.s. but many thought it could have been the polio vaccine.  This caused Buddy to worry constantly and buy his dear mother many gifts which dampered his budget temporarily.  Of course, once everyone found out that Buddy was leaving Ames to join the armed services and fight in the Vietnam War, there was a general hue and outcry.  Some students were patriotic and glad Buddy was following his heart.  Other students were not anti-war but they were very upset that Buddy was leaving Ames, Iowa and would be in harm's way on the frontlines of a bloody war.<br><br>
All this was happening when one day a knock came at his dorm room.  Buddy answered and saw the woman of his dreams, Karina.  She was a brunette, very attractive, outgoing.  She was wearing a poodle skirt and a nice blouse with sweater.  Karina was there to meet Buddy's roommate, Red.  However, Red was out at the time of her visit and the two, Karina and Buddy, fell madly in love.  From that point on they were often seen together and had many outings.<br><br>

Karina was from the finest suburb north of Chicago.  Her family is Hollywood royalty.  Two of her first cousins are very famous movie and tv actors.  She was very rich, of course.  She passed away around 2015 from natural causes.  She was born in sidereal leo, first decan, and her personality was very artistic and outgoing.  She had blue eyes and curly hair.  5'4", 115 lbs.  Many guys asked her out constantly but she was madly in love with Buddy.  Karina worked on campus of ISU as a soda-jerk and she met a prostitute who worked at the cafe.  Karina went to Guatemala with the prostitute to meet her family and see the country.  She never lost her love for spanish food after that trip, often cooking up vegetarian tacos in buffet style.<br><br>
Karina's mother was a nurse in Chicago at a hospital and that's where she met Karina's father, the son of a Danish immigrant.  Karina's grandparents were American (two of them) and the others were Danish and Norweigen.  Karina grew up with her maternal grandmother and parents along with brother on a large 5 acre estate with multiple homes in the best suburb of Chicago at that time, up to the north a wee bit from downtown.  Karina's father did not fight in the wars but he did work in the mills to support war effort even though he took a stand against the fire bombings and nuke attacks.  Her father was named Gilberto and he worked in furniture sales at Marshall Field's Department Store.  He too the train to work rather than pollute the air because at that time the fuel was heavily leaded and the air was thick with lead.  Nowadays, the fuel is unleaded which means no lead added but there's still some land and other dangerous pollutants in gasoline so we must all drive Teslas and Ford e-bikes when possible.<br><br>

When Karina found out that Buddy was going to leave ISU and join the armed services - foresake his role in the chemistry industry, she was at work (the campus cafe).  Karina immediately made plans to follow him and transfer her coursework to a college near his base assignment.   She went to see her advisor and planned to transfer her subjects and credits to a new suitable college with a matching course (computer science and home economics minor). The couple married in early December (3rd face Scorpio whole sign Hauser - Orphiuchus) and Buddy travelled the world as a high ranking enlisted man before achieving the ranks of NCO.  Buddy spent a lot of time in Japan and many other continents like Europe.  He worked for the intelligence service.  Nobody ever thought he would become a multi-millionaire because he was very unassuming and told a lot of jokes as is common in Iowa.  Another thing that happens in Iowa is this:  At Halloween the kids go trick and treating.  But the children are often required to tell jokes before they receive the candy.  And if they do not have a joke they may be teased a bit but Buddy always strove against teasing and such dirty tricks, he preferred to simply hand out the candy no questions asked.  Later in life, after Buddy had amassed his first 500k, he would sit on the front porch of his palacial estate and wait for the trickersters to arrive demanding candy.<br><br>

Buddy would wear a scary rubber mask and then jump out of his hiding place and scare the kids each Halloween on the porch.  It was a tradition the children looked forward to each year.  But one year the estate was lightly egged and Buddy took it personally, perhaps wrongly concluding that the egging was a result of the mask charades.  However, little did Buddy know, the egging was unrelated to his prants, rather the likely cause was his daughter's missteps.  Nevertheless, the incident took a toll on poor Buddy and he never again donned the mask of horrow, fearing retribution from scared Kinder.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div id="chap4"></div>
Chapter Vier<br>
Der Vietnam War<br><br>

Karina followed him all over the world but she mainly stayed in the USA on base and off-base.  The two moved to Denver, Washington, Alameda and several other locations before landing in Hillsborough, California area.  They rented a place south of Hillsborough and lived there for a short time before buying a huge mansion house in San Mateo County.  Buddy went to asia and fought the war and the kids stayed in California.  The couple lived in Fruitvale, Oakland for awhile and volunteered around the area, helping people from church with household chores.  Buddy was a wiz around a wrench, knew how to fix all kinds of appliances and vehicles.  So, it was natural for him to help out at church cutting grass and helping old ladies at their modest homes in Oakland.<br><br>
When Karina married Buddy, an Iowa farm boy, her parents (city slickers from one of the biggest cities in America) had reservations.  Karina's mother seemed pleased, after all, Karina had not attended prom or homecoming.  And Karina's mother Dora worried about her sometimes.  Her father was a sidereal capricorn (1st face) sun sign.    So, he was a successful salesman and outgoing at times, like for his career and later in life when he lived at The Sequoias in Portola Valley.  However, at home and with family he was more reserved.<br><br>

Buddy was out fighting the war, having turned his back on chemistry - instead working to end the war secretly along with an elite team of deep-thinkers in his platoon.   Travelling about asia Buddy worked hard to end the war through meetings filled with comedy and magic tricks which used his chemistry knowledge like home made fire crackers and ninja smoke tricks.  But Karina was left at home all by herself worried sick about Buddy and whether he would make it home safely from such a dangerous war assignment.  She wished he could be back in the chemistry lab, freeing mice and talking to researchers about how he can do simulations and animal experiments were not needed.  You see, Buddy has a deep love for animals and always did so he opposed animals in experiments, he talks to researchers and uses jokes - sometimes he convinces them to let the rats go and then he feeds them to his alligators.  But some get away and the cycle continues.  Yes, Buddy owns an alligator farm near New Orleans where he visited with Karina to see family, but now we are getting ahead of ourselves.   Back to the war.  Karina started meeting church friends and going to more church events like bible studies.  The war was unpopular so Karina and Buddy were not heralded in the community.  Rather, they had to not wear uniforms too much or fly flag because they did not want to provoke their neighbors in East Oakland or the ghetto in San Mateo County, once they moved there.<br><br>
So, the war dragged on for many years and Buddy wasn't injured.  He was fine but emotionally, the war took a toll on both sides.  After the war, Buddy found work with Pan American World Airways and went to New York City for training.  After that, he returned to San Francisco and worked downtown for many years while staying in the service part-time.  This is a story of rags to riches, but at this point in the story, it's mostly rags.  Karina, although she grew up in the finest suburb of Chicago, was born to a thrift father and grandmother so she did not know luxury.  Buddy was born into a poor farm family and barely had food to eat, not because of his father's fault, but just because the family was so big and his brothers were hungry.  There's never enough food or supplies for a family like that.  Even if Buddy's father was a millionaire, there would have been shortages in such a big family because just think of when you go shopping at local mom and pop store with a little kid.  What do they always want to do?  They will want to buy every single thing in the store.  So, you have to tell them, "No."  So, Buddy grew up wanting as many do all around the world.  However, Buddy became a multi-millionaire.  What was his secret?<br><br>
During the war, Buddy spent a lot of time in Hawaii and so Hawaii 5-0 and other Hawaii television shows were always Buddy's favorites along with many other shows like Charlie Sheen's comedies and Duck Dynasty.  He wore several different uniform colours during the war and steadily made his way up the ranks.  His uniforms were black, white and beige.  He had a jet black moustache and thick black head of hair.  He was always ready with a joke, a true Iowan in that comedian style.  Buddy never flinched when gunfire went off or when there was an air raid or a tornado.  He had nerves of steel like any true vegetarian chemist, particularly since he was an organic applied chemist, not just an inorganic theoretical chemist like some poof.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div id="chap5"></div>
Chapter Five<br>
Post-War Period<br><br>
After the war, Buddy had a few kids and so he was looking for a larger nest.  At the time he was stationed at Alameda and did work also at Treasure Island.  His wife found a place in the ghetto part of San Mateo County near Atherton.  It was a rental, a step up from their existence in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood.  Buddy took public transportation to his job in San Francisco.  He would have preferred a new corvette but the military doesn't pay like that.  And he sold his Chevrolet Impala to buy diapers and milk.  So, Buddy took the bus.  No fancy train, just a bus to work for many years.  He would bring a book and a radio with a earplug to listen to country music or news sometimes.  He never listened to politics, that's not his thing and besides, in those days there wasn't as much politics on the radio.  He had an am radio, favorite station was 910 KNEW, country music.<br><br>

It was around this time that Buddy started volunteering at his new church near Atherton.  He met a fellow chemist there who told him about the dangers of eating meat and fish.  At the church Buddy worked hard fixing and repairing many items around the spacious campus.  The church had a school with a chemistry lab as well and Buddy longed to be able to send his kids there but couldn't afford it but instead he volunteered in the chemistry lab teaching students and helping with the science fair.  You see, Buddy graduated with two college degrees.  One from Iowa and one from California, prestigious colleges.  Therefore, it was natural for him to find himself back in the lab running experiments and teaching students.  It is unknown whether or not Buddy was able to continue his scientific research, he says it is confidential and cannot discuss it, but we do know that Buddy was involved with chemical research for cancer cures and other cutting edge university projects based on scraps of paper found in an old wastebin.  Buddy says that he was sworn to secrecy.  At this time Buddy was still just as poor as an old possum.  So, Buddy kept working and volunteering and he drove old car which he worked on himself.  After the years went by Buddy was working two or three jobs plus volunteering to take care of the large family and freeloaders who always want this or that.  So, one day he was on a plane to Dulles airport in Washington, DC when a fellow traveller spoke with Buddy.  The traveller told Buddy about Cisco Systems and recommended Buddy buy that stock.<br><br>

Buddy bought Cisco stock with his small amount of savings back in the 1990s.  After Buddy, the golden boy, The Roman, bought shares, the stock took off like a rocket and Buddy became very wealthy on paper.  He took some money off the table, sold a bit of Cisco and bought other stocks like Apple and Microsoft.  Thus, Buddy became a multi-millionaire by purchasing stocks and working hard.  Then, he held the stocks and kept working.  After that he had plenty of bread and was able to take his wife out to eat daily, go on cruises around the world and much more like help out his shiftless grandkids.  However, he always wanted his pride and joy, his son, to work hard and achieve all the money by himself like Buddy did so that his son, Alfred, can feel the satisfaction of rising from poor to king of the hill.<br><br>

Because, you see, Buddy was quite poor when he raised Alfred and Alfred's sisters.  Sure, they had a house, a car.  But the kids rode the public bus to school and Buddy had to pay for the bus.  And it was a two-income family, the kids were often latch-key kids.  Also, Alfred was a model son but his sisters were often shall we say, disappointing, taking a car from a babysitting job without permission and wrecking it.  Stuff like that.  So, it caused Buddy quite a bit of worry along with Buddy's beautiful wife but luckily they had Alfred to fall back on.  Alfred took after Buddy and became a craftsman and amateur chemist.  People compared him to Don Juan and Einstein, perhaps because of his name or genius.  Alfred's sisters continued their devlish ways which did nothing but reek metaphorical havoc in the entirety of the western world much to the watchers' dismay.  However, there was a light at the end of the tunnel .... several of the sisters converted to vegetarianism like Buddy and changed their ways.  Buddy was relieved and he threw a big Iowa-style vegetarian BBQ with Beyond Meat products and Impossible Foods veggiedogs.  Everyone had a great time but all the excitement was exhausting for Buddy.<br><br>
After getting all the money, Buddy used it to travel and help charities and also attend high school reunions.  He went on a cruise to Hawaii and many trips there, especially to Oahu and Maui.  He went there with his son Alfred and he cherished the memory.  He also went to Hong Kong, Japan and all over the world with Alfred and Karina but they skipped places like Italia and unfortunately missed la France, Egypt, Greece, Palestine, Gaza, Persia, India.  But Buddy himself went to France, Greece and Italy with Karina, of course, and in the service.  They also went to Allemagne and all about Scandia.  So, when I say Buddy was well-travelled, I mean it in an extreme sense.  And Buddy was not a casual traveller.<br><br>
In the summertime, Buddy travelled with his family to camp in the traditional European style.  They spent a week at a vegetarian camp up in the Santa Cruz mountains where Karina worked as a fry-cook and Buddy cleaned the latrines, sometimes with his bare hand.  See, Buddy was never afraid of hard work.  Sure, he dislike working on plugged toilets and cleaning up soiled matresses, but his work in the military and before that on the farm and in the chemistry lab taught him to pinch his nose, dim the lights, shut his eyes and get 'er done.
As a traveller, Buddy often started off flying in coach, with the poor people.  He would arrive in a city with no luggage, just a few things like Rick Steves.  This would raise eyebrows because, for example, one time Buddy showed up in Helsinki at midnight with a five-person entourage and little luggage.  The hotel clerk was suspicious and so, Buddy was refused a suite of rooms!  Thus, Buddy and his entourage were left roaming the streets of Helsinki at midnight toting small bags, fortunately the weather was quite pleasant, it must have been summer.  It was cool and crisp, but not snowing.
<br><br>
Gilberto later met Karina and the family in Stockholm or Oslo and they had a ball, visiting museums and attractions around Scandia, finding out about Scandian chemists and chemistry discoveries, going on guided bus tours.  This was Buddy's style - always taking public transportation.  And his son and son-in-law are both public transportation devotees.  Buddy even worked for a bus company for many years, that's how much he loves the environment and feels alive when fighing for clean air and pushing back against pollution.  Buddy told people, "Unleaded fuel still has lead!" and they would be amazed by his wisdom and friendly manner of warning.  Buddy went on a cruise to Alaska with his lovely wife.  He even went on a cruise to Mexico with his daughter and her huge family and Buddy's wife was in attendance.  So, he did his best to satisfy everyone even though really his favorite things to do were volunteer in the community, visit his son Alfred, visit his brothers Franklin and Jamia and visit or call his dear sister Karina.  However, in order to make everyone happy he went on the cruises and trips around the country like the one to Jacob's wedding in Idaho which was doomed to divorce.  Jacob is a stout Christian, a Bible-thumper.  And Jacob really liked one of Buddy's daughters but she married a Mexican.<br><br>

So, Jacob went off to Alaska and served in the Air Force.  Later he met a beautiful bride and they married in Idaho.  Buddy attended, of course, but the bride left Jacob because she was more of a vegetarian and Jacob ate meat.  So it was a match made in hell.  That mean, the stars didn't align in good ways if you compare their charts.  Jacob probably has a lot of 9th Haus placements but he seemed also very sess-crazy as was common with his age range, must have been the outer planets in sidereal Scorpio and Libra perhaps.  But let's get back to the hero of our story.  There were periodic reunions in Iowa by a lake.  And Buddy would attend sometimes with his whole family.  Alfred made a striking guest and when he walks into a room, many heads turn, especially females.  However, when Alfred's sisters Penelope and Gwenevive walk into a room, all stomach turn and stand at attention in a metaphorical sense, if you will.  And it was in this manner that Buddy achieved the lofty heights of wealth, unltimately obtaining multiple real estate properties, many stocks, bonds, rare coins, precious metals, you name it.  And so, if a poor farm boy from Iowa, a would-be chemist can make it big in the USA, you can to my dear reader.  You can too!  You can be what you want to be.  But nothing is going to come easy in your life, not in your life!  So, let's all work hard and play hard like Buddy and who knows, maybe someday we'll be like him, beloved by the community, hunted by opposite sex and full of charm and wit, living his best life because he has plenty of bread.<br><br>

The best things in life are free, but it's nice to have some jingle in your pocket and the ability to be who you want to be and do what you want to do.  Suppose you want to be a sailor and help dolphins.  Well, if you have dough, if you have bread, you can do it.  But without bread, without dough, your options are far more limited.  Sure, you can go down to the harbour and hang out at the yacht club and try to find work as a crewman.  But who's gonna hire you with dirt on your face, a big disgrace, holes in your shoes, holes in your pants, pants on the ground?  So, it's good to have money.  And how did Buddy get money?  He started out with nothing.  NOTHING!  And now he's rich.  RICH!  So, if he can do it, maybe you can too.  What did Buddy do?  He bought stocks, especially good value stocks and Silicon Valley names along with deep value international vegan plans (think grain transportation or vegetable oils with fuel cell drive systems and teleportation).  See, he didn't buy Air France stock.  Sure, he could have.  It sounds good, Air France.  But look at it.  Look at it!!!  It's a dollar.  So, he would be poor if he would have bought Air France, dirt poor!<br><br>

So, why didn't he buy Air France stock?  Well, it's simple really.  Buddy only invests in vegetarian stocks like Silicon Valley semiconductor stocks, electronics companies and deep value plays.  He made some money on JC Penney, it's not a tech play but he got in and out, made some dough before he realized they sell leather so he said, "Oops," and stayed out of it.  Buddy avoids leather related stocks and index funds because they have leather and meat stocks.  So, here we'll leave our story for now.  Buddy is with his butler in Atherton living his best life.  Grandkids, great-grandkids.  He's very happy.  Can you be poor and happy?  Sure.  But, it's nice to have a little jingle and be able to help out your daughter when she has her car broken into and her purse stolen.  It's always something with Alfred's sisters, they're not like Alfred.  And so Buddy lived happily ever after in the kingdom that he built out of thousand dollar bills, gold coins, gold bars, and stock certificates.  Women from his Hare Krishna temple continue to hound him to this day, now that he laid his beautiful and lovely wife to rest.  Yes, he converted from Christianity to vegetarian religion so he aligns with Hare Krishna, Buddhist, Hindu.  But he doens't go for all the caste business and that jive.  He just likes the vegetarian feel and flare.  Buddy has gone from good to great and he made it look easy.  Buddy has it made in the shade, sippin' lemonade, and he did it in farm style, a true vegetarian hero.
